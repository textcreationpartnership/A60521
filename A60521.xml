            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:48772:3"/>by the impatient longing of Her Sons for your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips Election to the <hi>Preto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> Chair; in which, You were lately fixt by the moſt Unanimous Acclamations, and Solemn Joy of all Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous Spirits.</p>

            <p>The Obſcure Author (therefore) of this weak
<pb facs="tcp:48772:3"/>Eſſay, humbly craves your Pardon for his Preſumption in ſheltring it under the wing of ſo Judicious a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron. But your Honor's Courteous reception, and Equal Encouragement of All the Lovers of Vertue, begets an hope, That this honeſt Deſign to win Souls over to Chriſt, by ſo deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a Method, as a Perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive to a Weaned Self-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying Frame; may receive Life and Acceptation from
<pb facs="tcp:48772:4"/>the favourable Caſt of your eye upon an Argument ſo unpleaſing to the World's Fondlings and Admirers.</p>
            <p>Your Vertuous Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition hath ſet an Eminent Pattern, of that Weaned Frame herein jejunely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed of. For your Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Humility ſignalizes your Real Worth; upon which, your political Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure only <hi>waits,</hi> as the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namental Shadowing of ſome rare Beauty, which

            <p>Your Contempt of the glittering Imbelliſhments of the World, and reſolute Averſation from Its ſenſual Blandiſhments &amp; Delights, is ſufficiently known and demonſtrated.</p>
            <p>But I deſiſt from ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Truth in this kind, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe You have an Humble opinion of your Self; and I would not put Your Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty as much to the <hi>Bluſh,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:48772:5"/>as (I fear) my Weaning diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe will prove an <hi>Appale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> Alarm to perſons whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Devoted to the purſuit of Senſual Enjoyments, and the ſordid Humor of Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting to be flattered.</p>
            <p>The Author heartily wiſhes, that the Heavenly Diſcipline of Chriſt's Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit may allure All Men to the love of Evangelical Self-denyal. This would Promote and Secure their Beſt Everlaſting Intereſt, by

            <head>TO THE Chriſtian Reader.</head>
            <p>SUch is Natures tender Care for the Univerſe, that thoſe Births prove of the moſt Benign Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Babe, whoſe Parent expires in Travel. Thus, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence Delights to diſplay his Power and Goodneſs where en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious Death moſt <hi>Conflicts,</hi> as Contriving to exert It's deepeſt Sting. May the Conception and Edition of this Weak Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay obtain the Bleſſing of the Spirit of the Holy Jeſus: Then, That Paroxyſm of pain which ſeized on the Author in Preaching on part of this Argument (and poſſibly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat a fainter reception of it) will be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled to an Advantage, in the lively and
<pb facs="tcp:48772:6"/>deep Imprinting on the Heart, what at firſt with ſome Roughneſs beat upon the Ear. The Author cannot but apprehend, how unacceptable Weaning-Counſel is to perſons addicted to Senſuality; eſpecially, when conjoyned with Covetouſneſs, which is a Teſty Vice, as almoſt Univerſally grown in Faſhion. Yet the Father of Spirits is able ſo to Diſciplinate, and Change the Hearts of voluptuous Epicures, and the Worlds Votaries, that even Such ſhall be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to a Good Opinion of, and Imbrace the Seemingly-bitter Severities of a Wean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed State.</p>
            <p>This was the chief Encouragement in expoſing this Eſſay, (though of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comely and unpoliſht Features) unto Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick view. Otherwiſe, as a wounded diſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited Deer bleeds to Death in ſome Shrub; ſo, this Diſcourſe of Spiritual Wean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, had been ſtifled under the Shrowd of a faint-hearted Obſcurity, rather than have adventured to Liſp out ſuch unwelcome Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to the Worlds Fondlings and admiring Paramours.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:48772:7"/>
            <p>May the Bleſſing of Heaven aſſiſt every Inſpector of this Eſſay, in applying, and improving of the Rules herein contained, for the Acquiring and promoting of an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical Self-denying Frame. Thus, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing daily Converſant and skilful in this Myſtery, your hearts will be Abſtracted from liſtning to the Worlds alluring-Charms and Eſtranged from purſuing Its vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Vanities.</p>
            <p>The Vanity and wantonneſs of our hearts, which ſunk into a Senſual Life by Apoſtacy from the Cheifeſt Good, infuſed a Poiſonous Tincture and bewitching Charm into the External Creation, which was Innocent and ſafe to Converſe with, by its Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Inſtitution: Yet by ſerious Reflection on the impatient Abſurd longings of our humorſome Curioſity, we might rectify, and ſet boundaries to their Exorbitancies.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>David</hi> poured out the Waters of <hi>Bethlehem</hi> before the Lord, with as great an Abhorrency, as He had before expreſt an Homicidial Raſhneſs, in jeoparding the
<pb facs="tcp:48772:7"/>Lives of thoſe three mighty Men, by break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thorow the Hoſt of the Philiſtins to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it. If we would not buy our Pleaſures with the danger or deſtruction of our Souls, let us argue it coolely, and in ſober ſadneſs with our hearts, when our Luſts grow Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pant. Let us ſay as <hi>David,</hi> Are not theſe the Price of Bloud? It is certain they will prove ſuch: Either of Chriſt's Blood, to <hi>expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate</hi> our voluptuous Surfeits, or of our Own, to <hi>expoſe</hi> Us to deſtruction; if we Continue to gratifie our Fleſh-pleaſing Senſuality a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all Rules of Sobriety, and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates of Right Reaſon, which ſhould bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle and ſubdue them.</p>
            <p>How do moſt Men impoſe a Cheat upon their Souls, while they <hi>Symbolically</hi> only ſeek and expect Heaven, being Custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily buried with their Faces <hi>upward;</hi> yet while they live, they are not aſhamed to lye bruitiſhly grovelling with their Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on the Earth! Mynes which are hid under ground, tempt their thoughts, and commit a Rape upon their Souls, when the
<pb facs="tcp:48772:8"/>everlaſting Joys of Heaven, (becauſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen) are deſpiſed by them; Thus the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous Mammon is Worſhipt as a Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty! Yet the very natural form of Minerals which grow (as <hi>Sennertus</hi> reports) in the ſhape of Serpents and of Hairs, might fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warn them of thoſe miſchievous temptations, which Poiſon and Suffocate all Generous diſpoſitions Godward.</p>
            <p>But weaned Chriſtians foreſee, and dread a deſtructive ſnare even in thoſe inticing Objects, which Worldlings inſhrine in their hearts; ſo far are Saints from paying any Homage (but rather an Holy Scorn) toward whatever defiles and corrupts the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or diſpirits and divides the Heart from the Fountain of pure Celeſtial Joy.</p>
            <p>Let us therefore, as we would demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate our ſelves to be Divinely Born from Above, not lift up our hearts to Vanity, but to the Lords Statutes by a ſworn Allegiance. Let us not ſuffer Earthly-mindedneſs to <hi>grow</hi> in Faſhion, when the moſt durable Comforts in the World paſs away as a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:48772:8"/>
            <p>Be weaned and eſtranged from the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Cuſtoms, Corrupt Examples, and Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual Enjoyments of the degenerate World.</p>
            <p>So ſhall you Divinely Careſs your Souls, by training them up under the Severities of an Holy Diſcipline.</p>
            <p>You ſhall not by any Hurry-Cane of Temptation from <hi>without,</hi> or exorbitant Paſſions from <hi>within,</hi> be ſhaken from the Center of true Reſt, by deluſion in your Comforts, or Impatiency in your ſufferings. You ſhall poſſeſs &amp; ſecure your Souls, as to the Excellency of their Divine Conſtitution, in the <hi>quick,</hi> and <hi>clear</hi> Sentiment of Celeſtial Joys, by a <hi>regular</hi> Conception of the Real Worth of whatever is ſuggeſted to their Fancy. You ſhall become Impregnable in ſincere reſolutions, to maintain a Heavenly Converſation, and ſhall obtain an Heroick Fortitude under all your Tryals. You ſhall Exerciſe a Rational Dominion over all Bruitiſh Paſſions, which deſtroy all true Tranquillity of mind, and Joy in the Holy Ghoſt. Thus promoting a Weaned Frame,
<pb facs="tcp:48772:9"/>you ſhall be prepared and made meet to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with a triumphant Feſtivity into the Serene and Glorious Boſome of the bleſſed Jeſus, who is the perfect Archetype of Self-denial, and the Univerſal-Diffuſive-Center of true Felicity. To which State, that you may arrive, is the unfeigned deſire of Him, who counts it his Duty and Priviledg to be, and remain,</p>

                  <p>Surely I have behaved and quieted my ſelf as a Child that is weaned of his Mother, my Soul is even as a weaned Child.</p>
                  <p>Let Iſrael hope in the Lord, from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth and for ever.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Heſe words are <hi>Davids</hi> Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getical Appeal to God, the Searcher of all Hearts, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute and wipe off that malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſlander, that he was an underminer of <hi>Saul's</hi> Regal Authority; and an ambitious Projector to ſnatch the Crown from his Head.</p>
            <p>Now ſaid he, what Plots can a weaned Child contrive in its Head? I do not buſie my ſelf in Myſteries of State, nor deal in the profound Politicks of the World.</p>
            <p>Lord I Appeal to thy alſearching Eye, who knoweſt all ſecrets whatſoever, that my Heart
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48772:10"/>is not haughty, nor mine <hi>Eyes</hi> lofty. <hi>Theſe,</hi> in the caſting of them, ſpeak out much of the frame of the Soul; They are the Heraldry of the Mind: By the eyes we expreſs and dart forth Pride, Malice, and Luſt.</p>
            <p>Sobriety, a modeſt look, without Heart-Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, is Hypocrifie; and Lowlineſs of Heart without a modeſt Deportment, is but a rude Profeſſion.</p>
            <p>In the Words are two General Parts.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>David's</hi> Proteſtation, under the Form of an Oath; thus ſome read the Words; <hi>If I have,</hi> or, <hi>as I have behaved my ſelf as a weaned-Child, then</hi> or in <hi>ſo</hi> doing, let the Lord vindicate my Integrity from falſe Aſperſions. So let the Lord deal by me, as I have in uprightneſs ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt all Proud Aſpiring Imaginations and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſ.</hi> We ſhould be on good and ſure Grounds in all thoſe Appeals and Proteſtations which we make of our Hearts in the Frame and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of them as in the ſight of God, who is the Heart-ſearcher, and Avenger of all Hopocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. <hi>David's</hi> Soul was firſt weaned by the Diſcipline of God's Spirit, before he could behave himſelf as a weaned Child in the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral afflictive occurrences of his Life.</p>
            <p>Grace muſt firſt be implanted in the Heart, to quiet and ſubdue its mutinous Paſſions, and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48772:10"/>inordinate affections, before the outward Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation can be rectifyed.</p>
            <p>The Lord can take no delight in the proud Heart of a froward Sinner.</p>
            <p>Yet a Saint may without Preſumption plead thus: Lord, <hi>own</hi> me for thy Child, for I am one of thy Weanlings, therefore come and take delight in thine own Work.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>David</hi> appeals to God, concerning his ſelf-denying-frame, as an evident Sign and Seal of his Approbation and Promotion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſ.</hi> Before the Lord beſtow great enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Creature upon his Servants, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares <hi>them</hi> by a weaned Frame of Heart, (ſo as) to be indifferent about Worldly things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Soul.] David</hi> was a ſtrong Man in Chriſt, not a Babe, who thus profeſt himſelf as a wean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Child.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſ.</hi> It requires not only Truth of Grace, but much growth and proficiency in it, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign up the Heart to the ſeverities of Mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and conſtant Diſcipline of Self-denyal.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſ. David</hi> ſays not my Soul is only meek and humble as a <hi>Child,</hi> but ſubmiſſive, as a <hi>weaned</hi> Child, to every Divine Diſpenſation, though never ſo harſh and bitter; yea he riſes higher, Profeſſing himſelf to be <hi>even</hi> as a wean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Child in <hi>all</hi> and <hi>every</hi> Reſpect.</p>
            <p>The Rule of God's Word and Command is a ſtricter Pattern of ſelf-denial than any Earthly
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48772:11"/>Type of weaning. No weanling from the Breſt ſhould outſtrip a Saint in point of Mortification toward ſinful ſenſual Delights, or Creature-en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments.</p>
            <p>Again, <hi>David</hi> compares himſelf to a Child which is Paſſively weaned, not which weans <hi>it ſelf;</hi> Weaning is not any pleaſant Act of the Childs own ſeeking or effecting.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſ.</hi> Mortification of ſinful unruly Paſſions and inordinate affections, is a Soul-<hi>renewed</hi>-ſtate, bitter and declined by us at firſt, we are meerly Patients under this Holy violence, and Soul-ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſeverity; we are unwilling and <hi>unable</hi> to effect in it our ſelves.</p>
            <p>Again, <hi>David</hi> compares himſelf to a Child weaned of his <hi>Mother,</hi> not by ſome mercenary Nurſe, who being <hi>ſervile</hi> in the task proves of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as froward and teaſty as the Child.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſ.</hi> Saints ſhould ſubmit to the difficulty of a weaned Frame with a quiet Heart, becauſe the Lord deſigns it out of Wiſdom, and carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it on with great tenderneſs and Compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>The weaned Child is not forgotten, much leſs forſaken, or caſt off. Weaning is an Act and State of neceſſity and deep affection, ratherthan of neglect or diſeſteem.</p>
            <p>Hereby it grows up into a more ſolid know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of, and more affectionate acquaintance <hi>with the Parent.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:48772:11"/>
            <p>Should Children always lie ſoaking at the Breaſt, they would not grow ſo ſtrong nor ſpritely to perform ſervice to their Parents, they would not be apt to take down more ſolid Food.</p>
            <p>Saints may be froward at preſent, becauſe they underſtand not the advantages of this pitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſeverity; yet afterwards they ſhall know and comply with the Lord's Deſign in weaning them.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Chriſt</hi> informed <hi>Peter,</hi> that there was a Myſtery in his condeſcention to waſh the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples Feet, the better to induce <hi>Peter's</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with it. Thus <hi>David</hi> produces his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, and makes aſſurance thereof, to the whole Spiritual Seed of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> that the Lord means no harm but much Spiritual advantage to his Children, though he expreſs much ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in weaning them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſ.</hi> Saints ought to quicken one anothers Graces and Comforts, by holding forth their mutual examples and experiences.</p>
            <p>As if <hi>David</hi> had ſaid, upon the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thus: Lord, hereby I gathered or inferred an Evidence, that thou wouldeſt advance me to the Throne, and undertake the Protection, Care and Conduct of me, becauſe I have beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved my ſelf as a Weaned Child. I kept my Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit low and humble; I did not affect nor hunt after great things for my ſelf; I was very indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:48772:12"/>as to the outward enjoyments of the World. Thou haſt heapt them on me <hi>without</hi> my ſeeking. Thou didſt prepare me to injoy with an humble thankful Heart, thoſe accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modations which I could have been content to have been cut ſhort of.</p>
            <p>Lord, thou knoweſt how I have carried to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thee as a weaned Child. Thou alſo haſt acted towards me as a tender indulgent Parent, giving me what I could have born the denial of. Therefore by my Example let <hi>Iſrael</hi> hope in the Lord, even when he is ſuatcht from the Breaſts of worldly enjoyments. O! let Saints learn to live more dependently upon the Lords immediate Providence, who thus rewards the ſelf-denial of his weaned Children.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This is the</hi> ſcope and intended meaning of the Words.</p>
            <p>The main Doctrine which I ſhall proſecute is this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> Every Chriſtian ſhould labour to get and maintain the Frame and Carriage of a weaned Child.</p>
            <p>In proſperity to ſit looſe from Worldly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts and enjoyments. In Adverſity to quiet and compoſe their pirit under all the ſaddeſt, ſevereſt Diſpenſations which the Lord inflicts.</p>
            <p>Or, 'tis the Duty, Character, and Diſpoſition of every real Saint, by Faith and Self-denial, to quiet their ſpirits under the neareſt and deepeſt Tryals.</p>
            <pb n="7" facs="tcp:48772:12"/>
            <p>By Faith we muſt live <hi>on</hi> Chriſt's Alſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in greateſt ſtraits. By Self-denial we muſt live to Chriſt by maintaining an equal indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency of Spirit either to retain or reſign our Comfortable enjoyments as the ſupream <hi>Lord ſhall diſpoſe of them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It becomes not that Maſculine Heroical Grace of Faith, to produce every petty ſervice as a Demonſtration of its Ingenuity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Abrahams</hi> Tryal, was no cheap Act of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, when he was called to the foot of God, to leave his native Country, and become a Pilgrim in the Land of Promiſe.</p>
            <p>Yet in weaning him from his Beloved <hi>Iſaac,</hi> ſo as to require him to offer him up for a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; <hi>This</hi> toucht ſeverely upon the very Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of Natural Affection, yea, it ſeemed to offer violence to his Faith, and the very veracity of that Divine Promiſe, that in <hi>Iſaac</hi> ſhould all Nations be called and bleſſed.</p>
            <p>O the height, length, depth, and breadth of this Tryal! None could lawfully impoſe ſuch a Command but God, nor could any ſo quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and fully have Anſwered it but an <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> whence he deſerved the Title of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Faithful.</p>
            <p>He ſtood not demurring, much leſs murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the Command, but thus he expreſt the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency and weaned ſelf-denyal of his Heart.</p>
            <pb n="8" facs="tcp:48772:13"/>
            <p>What is it, O Lord, that thou calleſt for? is it my only begotten Son <hi>Iſaac,</hi> the Staff of my old Age? I love him dearly, but thee tranſcendent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; therefore he ſhall be no Corrival. I obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him by believing, and I ſhall not loſe him by obeying,</p>
            <p>Though I be a Father, thou art God; and what I owe to my Child, muſt alway be checkt and limited by what I owe to thee.</p>
            <p>My Natural affection <hi>muſt and ſhall</hi> give place to my Spiritual ſpecial Duty.</p>
            <p>Though I kill him, thou canſt quicken him; Though I may part with my Son, yet I can never loſe my <hi>Iſaac.</hi> For thy Promiſe is ſure for evermore, that in <hi>Iſaac</hi> ſhall my Seed be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Abraham</hi> reconcil'd by a weaned Frame the ſeeming contradiction of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to the immutability of the Promiſe, and choſe rather to be held Guilty of Murther, by the verdict of ſenſe and carnal reaſon, than to be taxt of mental Idolatry, in an over-fond Affection to his <hi>Iſaac.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He let God alone to perform his Word, while himſelf kept an eye upon his Duty.</p>
            <p>Do you go and imitate the Father of the Faithful. I mean not in the ſame ſpecifical at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, for it was only a Command by way of Tryal, impoſed by the lawful ſtamp of Divine Authority. No ſuch Revelation is now to be
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48772:13"/>expected; yet the general and implicite equity of it binds all and every Chriſtian, that we ſhould alway retain a fixt weaned Frame, to mortifie all inordinate Creature-Love; and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily to reſign up our neareſt and deareſt injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, when the Supream Lord ſhall impoſe the Tryal.</p>
            <p>So ſhall you juſtifie the Truth, and command the ſtrength of your Faith, as <hi>Abraham</hi> did his by Self-denial, and obtain the Title of a real Friend of God.</p>
            <p>Such are content that the Will of the Lord ſhould be ſerved <hi>upon</hi> them as well as done <hi>by</hi> them, or the promiſes fulfilled <hi>for</hi> them.</p>
            <p>Now for fuller explication of the Nature of this weaned Frame, I ſhall ſhew,</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Wherein it doth conſiſt.</item>
               <item>2. How Natural and Spiritual weaning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree and differ.</item>

               <item>5. I ſhall lay down the true Character or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of a weaned Saint.</item>
               <item>6. Some Motives or Arguments to perſwade to a weaned Frame.</item>
               <item>7. and Laſtly, I ſhall lay in ſome Principles or Rules, whereby we may get and maintain ſuch
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:48772:14"/>an <hi>Evangelical</hi> Self-denying diſpoſition.</item>
            </list>
            <p>For the Firſt.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is the Judicious Elective Frame of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Regenerate perſon, whereby he doth with a ſupernatural Patience ſilence the mutinous mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring Paſſions of his Soul under the ſaddeſt methods which Divine Wiſdom makes uſe of, to eſtrange and mortifie his fond inordinate Love to <hi>every Lawful,</hi> much more ſinful enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Or, it is ſuch a State in Grace, not in Nature, whereby the Heart is wrought not only to a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient ſubmiſſion, but a chearful complacential rejoycing in whatever the Lord requires or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſes for the Tryal of its Love and ſincere O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, both Active and Paſſive.</p>
            <p>Or, it is a choice Chriſtian Frame, received from our Union and Communion with Chriſt, and the anointing of his Spirit, whereby we renounce our Carnal Wiſdom, our froward per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe Will, and all inordinacy of fond overva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luing, and affecting of Creature-enjoyments.</p>
            <p>Thus we reſign all we are and have, to the Sovereign, Wiſe, and Holy diſpoſal of the Lord.</p>
            <p>Hereby we teſtifie the ſincerity, ſtrength, and perſeverance of our Love, as preferring the Lord alone to our delight before any Competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor whatſoever.</p>
            <pb n="11" facs="tcp:48772:14"/>
            <p>Natural and Spiritual weaning, agree in theſe Reſpects.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A weaned Child is very humble. It hath no proud Heart, atteſted by any ſcornful look or peeviſh Carriage. They expreſs no boaſting Language to the diſdain of others.</p>
            <p>So a Saint is weaned from an overfond con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of his own Worth and Excellency. Vain Man would be wiſe, he would paſs for ſuch in the Opinion of himſelf and others.</p>
            <p>But the power of Renewing Grace lays him level with the Duſt. Before he walkt in a vain ſhow, ſtrutting and applauding himſelf in the tinkling of his own imaginary excellencies, yet by Converting Grace, the, Top-Gallant of his ſelf-deifying Pride is laid proſtrate at the foot of Chriſt, in admiring only the Riches of free Grace, and the imputed <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> of a Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Weanlings expreſs more of Contentation than of Contention or diſcontent.</p>
            <p>All frowardneſs of Spirit flows from Pride. But you may deal with a weaned Child as you pleaſe. Turn it upſide down, ſtrip it of its Ornaments, it ſubmits, it doth not revile nor ſpurn.</p>
            <p>So a weaned Saint complies with, yea reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, welcomes and imbraces every change and turn of Providence. He expoſtulates not with the Supream Lord and abſolute Potter, who
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:48772:15"/>hath an uncontrouled Dominion over his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, State, and Condition in the World.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Aaron</hi> repined not to ſtrip himſelf of his Prieſtly Robes, and inveſt <hi>Eleazar</hi> with them, though it were ſolemnized with his own immediate diſſolution. His ambition was ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued, and his affections mortified to the Pride of Life.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Moſes</hi> dyed at the Mouth of the Lord, at the Word of his Command, being ſatisfyed only with a Proſpect of <hi>Canaan,</hi> as the reward of his Faithful tedious conduct of that muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous People even to the Borders of the pleaſant Land.</p>
            <p>Therefore the Lord kiſt his ſoul out of his Body, (as the <hi>Rabbins</hi> ſpeak:) He put more ſignal honour on him, in tranſlating him to the ſuperlative effuſions of his choiceſt Love; becauſe he ſo readily went up to the Mount and dyed.</p>
            <p>How was <hi>David</hi> weaned to a wonderment, as if he were at a point whether he died in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of his Rebellious <hi>Abſolom,</hi> or returned in Triumph as a Conquerer, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.25, 26. If I ſhall find favour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Hezekiah</hi> ſaid, Good is the Word and Work of the Lord, though <hi>Iſaiah</hi> threatned that his Kingly dignity ſhould be ecclipſt in the future Captivity of his Nation, and that the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:48772:15"/>
               <hi>Babylonians</hi> ſhould poſſeſs all his Treaſures, which had been the occaſion of his Pride.</p>
            <p n="3">3. A weaned Child may bemoan its loſs of its wonted delight, in applying to the Breſt, thoſe pleaſant Conduits of Nature, yet at laſt it yields to the Mothers Act with ſilence and a quiet Frame.</p>
            <p>So Saints do not expect to be alway indulged in their Childiſh will and Appetite; only here is the difference: A Saint out of a judicious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, chearfully ſubmits, in preferring a weaned State before the higheſt injoyments of the Creature. He chooſes for his happineſs to behold the Face of God in Righteouſneſs, and is ſatisfied with the Image of Chriſt upon his Soul.</p>
            <p>Even in his firſt Converſion, he hath a high eſtimation of Chriſt and the things of Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, yet becauſe the Scale is but a little turned by a few grains of Faith and Love, he doth not ſo readily draw off his Affections from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanting Objects of this preſent Life.</p>
            <p>But having attained to a more Maſculine State in Chriſtianity, he eſpyes at laſt, a Soul-ſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fulneſs-even in a weaned Frame it ſelf.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Paul</hi> being filled with the Spirit, had the comprehenſion of all happineſs furniſht out unto him, from the Treaſury of Chriſt's alſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency; this weaned him to contentment with any thing or nothing of the Creature, ſo that
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:48772:16"/>he could glory in all Diſtreſſes, and truly aver, that he needed not any Gift from the World; for ſaid he, I am full, I abound, I have all. His Bonds were as Bridal Ornaments, and his very nakedneſs and ſtock of ſufferings were preferred before the Wardrobe and Treaſuries of all the Kings of <hi>Judah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. A weaned Child repines not, though it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change Breſt-Milk, which is pleaſant, eaſie of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion, for harſher and meaner Food; Becauſe it is not wiſe enough to provide for it ſelf, therefore of neceſſity it lives at the finding and diſpoſal of the Parent.</p>
            <p>So a Saint ſubmits his Will to the Wiſdom of Divine Providence, to order and guide his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and affairs, to over-rule and controul his inordinate Appetite. He knows that among the variety of Eſtates in the World, he might miſtake Henbane for wholſome Food, a Stone for Bread-Corn, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He is afraid when his Deſires <hi>grow Feaveriſh</hi> and voracious, leſt he ſhould ſuck Vanity and vexation of Spirit from Worldly Peace, Plenty, and Proſperity.</p>
            <p>Therefore he counts it ſafeſt to refer himſelf to Divine Wiſdom, who only knows what nouriſhment he can beſt digeſt, what State of Life he can beſt manage and improve.</p>
            <p>By ſelf-Abaſement he puts no confidence in his own Wit or Strength. He wholly depends
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:48772:16"/>on the Lord's care and Favour. He lives by Faith upon the Promiſe, and is content with his allotted Portion in the World. He counts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unworthy of the leaſt of mercies; yea, to be quickned up to his Duty by the Rod of God. His Will and deſires are circumſcribed &amp; limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Wiſdom and Sovereignty of the Lord. He can rejoyce when reduced to a ſtate of empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and abaſement.</p>
            <p>He doth not preſcribe to the Lord, how he ſhall diſpoſe of him in his Perſon and Relations, Comforts or Tryals. But is ſutably moulded by a ready and chearful compliance, to be caſt into any form or Condition of Life Divine Providence ſhall ſee fit. This doth prove our humble and weaned Frame to be ſincere: for the change of our Condition, and the external Garb of our Profeſſion doth not promote the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Work of Mortification.</p>
            <p>The ſetled Diſeaſe of Pride and inordinacy of Affection to the Creature, muſt be carried off by ſound Repentance, Faith in the Purgati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt's Blood; by a Sympathetical Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to his Death and Reſurrection, in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt over our ſelves, and the irregularities of our hearts, as well as by a profeſt contemptuous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing of all alluring lying Vanities.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The weaned Child is not in ſo great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to be overlaid.</p>
            <pb n="16" facs="tcp:48772:17"/>
            <p>Thus the World in its diſtruſting <hi>Cares</hi> and diſtracting <hi>Fears,</hi> is a ſtrange ponderous <hi>Incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus</hi> or Night-Hag, which over-rides and preſſes its Paramors unto death.</p>
            <p>Senſual Luſts, a Load of Worldly Contrivan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to be Rich and Great, yea, pleaſing hopes, and Senſual Joys, thoſe very Comforts and Delights which promiſe as Foſter-Parents, to batten us by their flatteries, theſe, even theſe betray us, by ſtifling the Seed-Royal of Gracious Diſpoſitions and Affections in the Soul.</p>
            <p>But a weaned mortified Chriſtian, can vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly caſt off thoſe preſſures of Temptation, the ſuffocating foul humors of Luſting, which like an <hi>Incubus</hi> ſhorten and obſtruct the free breathings of the Spirit of Grace and ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: He can ſtrongly cry out, Abba, Father, ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cor me by thy preventing aſſiſting-Grace, that I may not be overlaid, nor preſt to Death by ſecular Cares, Comforts, or Delights.</p>
            <p n="6">6. It's a very difficult task to wean off a Child from hankring after the Breſt.</p>
            <p>So 'tis very tedious and painful to corrupt Fleſh and Blood, which remains in part unſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued in the beſt of Saints, to have ſo great a change made in their unruly Appetite, that what before they loved, now they hate, <hi>&amp; contra.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is demonſtrated,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe our ſenſual Hearts make great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance to this Renovation in the Spirit. It's as
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:48772:17"/>Death to a Carnal heart, becauſe 'tis no other than the diſſolution of the Carnal-State of a Sinner.</p>
            <p>Some are ſooner weaned off with the very Nod and Beck of God. But others, muſt be fiercely dealt withal, as <hi>Paul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As the Voice <hi>of a Thunder-clap makes</hi> the Hinds to Calve and caſt forth their young, becauſe they have very narrow paſſages in Nature:</p>
            <p>So Sinners are <hi>averſe from</hi> Spiritual weaning, therefore uſually, <hi>the Spirit of Bondage <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſhers it in,</hi> by ſome <hi>Black Rod, or Apparitor</hi> which makes the <hi>very ſhadow of Death</hi> to ſit on our Eye-lids, before our proud Spirits will be tamed and brought to hand, by the ſhaking of an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Rod over us.</p>
            <p>Some the Lord weans by the ſoft gentle whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of his Spirit, convincing them of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and emptineſs of the whole Creation.</p>
            <p>Thus the Lords Word ſtood for a Law with <hi>Levi,</hi> who knew neither Father nor Mother, ſo as to diſpenſe the <hi>Divine</hi> Law with Carnal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fondneſs, and partiality of affection.</p>
            <p>The powerful Charms of Divine Love, and the Spiritual appearances of the Lord in the Luſtre and Glory of his Alſufficiency and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Perfections, prevail with ſome to fall off not only from the lank and Crude Breaſt of the Creature, but from the faireſt and plumpeſt of their Enjoyments.</p>
            <pb n="18" facs="tcp:48772:18"/>
            <p>Yet neither frowns nor ſmiles, neither Blows nor Charms of Love, can prevail with ſome ſoaking ſenſualiſts to quit the allurements of Luſt and the World.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jeſhurun,</hi> who carried the Title of Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs in their very Name, could not be weaned from the Garlick and Fleſh-pots of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> but keckt at <hi>Manna,</hi> at Angels Food; yea, ſnarled at God himſelf, becauſe their Dog-like Appetite was not indulged with Quails.</p>
            <p>They could not be made fond of their great Redeemer, nor, did they cleave to him, though he broacht the Rock to ſatisfie them as with Streams of Honey; rather they waxed Fat and kickt, by how much the more they were pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered and indulged.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The difficulty of Spiritual weaning far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther appears, from the frequent pains and ſtrange methods, which the Lord himſelf takes to <hi>imbitter</hi> the Creature, uſing very ſharp affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to draw off our fond affections from an Idolatrous doting on the World.</p>
            <p>A ſtrange dulneſs or rather perverſeneſs poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes us, that we muſt be laſht into our own Happineſs, and beaten into an ingenuous Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty from the vaſſalage of our Luſts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lots</hi> Wife, though ſhe were fired out of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> yet left her heart behind, for ſhe lookt back, ſhe lookt and lookt again, till ſhe became ſliff and ſtupid as a ſtone.</p>
            <pb n="19" facs="tcp:48772:18"/>
            <p>Thus <hi>Agrippina</hi> ſaid of <hi>Nero, Occidat modo Imperet.</hi> Sinners care not if they be damned, ſo they may not be damnified in their Worldly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt.</p>
            <p>They will adventure an Eternal Exciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or cutting off from the priviledges of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life, which is worſe, than a bare Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the ſoreſt loſs of their Temporalities, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they will cleave to God himſelf rather than the <hi>Dinah</hi> of this inchanting World. They will part with their Religion, rather than not enjoy their Wealth and Honour without hazard or diſturbance.</p>
            <p>Thus we Adore the Creature, and thereby force the Lord to put on the diſguize of an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, to fright us into a weaned Frame.</p>
            <p>The Candle of Proſperity muſt be put out, yea, the whole Heaven over us muſt mourn in Sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth; the Lord muſt deſert us, and leave us to the amazement of a wounded Conſcience, before we will deſiſt from neſtling in the Boſome of that Creature which we Idolize.</p>
            <p>Again, Satan and the World, when we ſeem to be weaned, renew their acquaintance, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate their allurements afreſh, to reduce us to their imbraces. Thus the Child hardly cleaves to the Parent, when the Nurſe ſtudies and ſtrives to regain the Childs fondneſs by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting and tempting it with Toyes and Rat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles.</p>
            <pb n="20" facs="tcp:48772:19"/>
            <p>But every Soul which would thorowly be weaned, muſt reſolve in the Lord's Strength, not to liſten to Satan's or the World's inticing Charms.</p>
            <p>Reply, Go Satan, offer theſe petty Vanities to Children and Fools, who know not what the worth of Chriſt, or of an immortal Soul a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount unto. I am better diſciplined in the ſeverities of a Holy and Heavenly profeſſion, I am not ſo fondly in love with Vanity, as to purchaſe it with the torment of a wounded Conſcience, by betraying of my Loyalty and the Chaſtity of my Soul to Chriſt.</p>
            <p>It is juſt matter of wonder, with what ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Reverence, ſordid and abſurd Zeal, Popiſh Novices ſwear ſubjection to the perverting Rules of ſome ſuperſtitious Founder.</p>
            <p>One, devoted to the Commands of his Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intendent, went barefoot three Miles thrice in the ſame day, to fetch Water to pour out on a dry ſtick.</p>
            <p>Yet let the Spirit of Jeſus attempt to bring us out of Love with Worldly Vanities, and the cuſtoms of phantaſtick ſinners, how do we cry out of this Compaſſionate Diſcipline, as of an intolerable ſeverity.</p>
            <p>What pinching Fetters are Chriſt's Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Laws, to the tender delicate Luſts of ſenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Worldlings.</p>
            <pb n="21" facs="tcp:48772:19"/>
            <p>Let ſuch conſider, how dangerous it is, not to comply with the Lord's weaning Methods.</p>
            <p>For as an angry Nuiſe throws the froward weanling out of her Aims to the Beds feet: ſo the Lord will in toſſing, toſs ſuch is a Ball, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a large and far Country, where the ſeverity of an Enemy ſhall inſult over them, to break their proud Spirits, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 22.15. to 20.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Though weaning be a work of difficulty, yet it muſt be carried thorow, becauſe 'tis a State very neceſſary and not indifferent.</p>
            <p>Thoſe Children who ſuck long, are not ſo witty nor ſo vigorous and active, but more dull comparatively, and effeminate, becauſe they have been made ſuch fondlings.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle poſſibly alludes to the inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of remaining too long in the State of Babeſhip in Chriſtianity, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.12, 13, 14.</p>
            <p>As if he had ſaid, ſo great is your Spiritual ſloth and dulneſs, in not underſtanding the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of the Goſpel, that you have need be ſet to learn the very Principles of the Chriſtian In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution.</p>
            <p>But the weaned Chriſtian can diſcover the Myſtery of Iniquity; the grand cheats of Satan and the World. His faculties and affections have a Divine Guſt, or experimental apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of what is ſuitable to the State of a New Creature.</p>
            <pb n="22" facs="tcp:48772:20"/>
            <p>Such can cry out, Poyſon in the Cup, when a temptation to ſin, though never ſo ſweetly ſpiced, is amicably preſented to them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. You cannot, unleſs you have a weaned Spirit, be in the leaſt capacity of cloſing with Chriſt by Faith.</p>
            <p>Till we be eſtranged from Creature-Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencies, we will not ſtoop to Glean after Chriſt in the Field of his Righteouſneſs, nor lie at his Feet as <hi>Ruth</hi> at <hi>Boaz</hi>'s, by an humble Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denyal. Such need not fear, that their Love to Chriſt ſhall be deſpiſed, for he will do all that they ſhall require, when he obſerves that they have quitted all Corrivals and are heart-ſick in affection toward himſelf, by the ſolid prefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of his Favour, before all the delights and Courtſhip of the whole Creation.</p>
            <p>Thus the Lord's <hi>Marab's,</hi> his Children, whom he, weans in the bitterneſs of their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, ſhall become his <hi>Naomies,</hi> his fair Ones, or Spouſes of Delight: yet firſt they muſt be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate in themſelves, that they may learn to cleave to the Lord as the Center of their truſt and ſatisfaction. This is the very Law of their Eſpouſals unto Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There is an abſolute neceſſity of this wean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed State, otherwiſe the Spirit of the World, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, and Luſt, will rule in your hearts and hold you under their Vaſſalage. How will every petty temptation worry out your formal &amp; faint
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:48772:20"/>reſiſtance? Nay, you will never ſtrike ſtroke out of the baſe treachery of your ſenſual-hearts. Your Mouths will rather water after forbidden Fruit, you will tempt the Tempter to tempt you; and caſt your ſelves as a Prey into the Jaws of this devouring Lyon.</p>
            <p>How ſhould the Apoſtacy of ſuch who have ſurfeited on their Luſts, to a loathing of all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, ſeaſon our hearts with a Holy-Fear, not to diſdain or oppoſe this Self-denying Frame!</p>
            <p>O do not truſt to the Eminency of your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent profeſſion, but make God the Guide and Guardian of your hearts. Get them thorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly weaned from the Love of Luſts and the World; otherwiſe you will be expoſed to an open renouncing of the Faith of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Voetius</hi> in his Diſputes of <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> relates of one <hi>Vaninus,</hi> who was a ſad inſtance in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect. He wrote a Book entituled the <hi>Amphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theater of Divine Providence,</hi> to prove that there is a God; yet afterwards he Apoſtatiz'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a meer ſpeculative dogmatizing Atheiſt, and was burned at <hi>Paris</hi> for it. Thus the faireſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maliſts, make the ſubtleſt Seducers, the fierceſt Perſecutors, and moſt deſperate Atheiſts. This appeared in the ſaid <hi>Vaninus,</hi> who being advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed at his Execution, to ask God, the King, and his Judges Pardon; <hi>thus</hi> replyed, I <hi>need not</hi> ask Pardon of God, for I do not believe there is any, nor of the King, for I have broken none of his

            <p>Thus the unclean Spirit re-entred, to take up a <hi>ſurer</hi> Station, without any fear of diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance, or a future diſpoſſeſſion.</p>
            <p>Such will be the End of all <hi>Maſquarading</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors, who only make a <hi>Mock-ſhow</hi> of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>

            <p>What ſayſt thou! Art thou a Weanling of Chriſt's, or a Nurſling and Fondling of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans?</p>

            <p>Even <hi>Children</hi> retain in their fancy the bitter ſeverities uſed for their alienation from the Breſt.</p>
            <p>Let ſoaking Worldlings look on their tracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble example, and be aſhamed of their <hi>own</hi> greedy ſnatching at Worldly proſperity, though it poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon the Vital briskneſs of the Soul in not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting

               <p>A general <hi>ſlight</hi> Conviction of the Creatures Vanity, will not prove ſufficient to wean us from all Priding in our own conceited Worth and the Opinion of ſelf-ſufficiency.</p>

               <p>For a meer form of Godlineſs ſpends it ſelf in airy ſpeculations, and in boaſting of a conceited Conqueſt over Luſts and the World.</p>
               <p>But a Holy Frame of Heart, is the Life of Chriſt himſelf, dwelling and acting in every New-Born Chriſtian, in whom it hath a ſecret Vertue, to accompliſh a wonderful Conqueſt in weaning of the heart.</p>
               <p>The power of Godlineſs begets Divine Fear, this <hi>Contracts</hi> the heart toward the Creature, and unites or inlarges it to God in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Now a Holy <hi>Oneneſs</hi> of Spirit fortifies the affections, as the Rays of the Sun contracted

               <p>It brings with it, an ingenuous freedom of ſpirit, to ſerve the Lord with chearfulneſs, as his Redeemed and peculiar Ones.</p>

                  <hi>By theſe ſtrange</hi> ſudden Ague-fits, we may learn, not to confide in the beſt Conſtitution of <hi>habitual</hi> Grace, but to exerciſe a holy jealouſie of the <hi>variation</hi> of a weaned Frame, when the Souls Pulſe is in <hi>the</hi> beſt <hi>and moſt eaven</hi> temper of a heavenly diſpoſition.</p>

               <p>When the World proves <hi>Coy, Curſt</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, then we can <hi>Curſe</hi> its Treachery. As froward Children, we <hi>bite</hi> the Nipple, when it doth not ſo freely ſpin out to us a Stream of proſperity ſuitable to our greedy expectation.</p>

               <p>Thus, while Divine Providence <hi>beſmears</hi> the World's Paps with Soot, and cries out, do not touch them as you love your Life, we ſhrink

               <p>He <hi>Eyes</hi> in his Civil Calling, the Inſtitution of God, the Conduct of his Word, and pleads the Promiſes in Prayer for his incouragement in difficult Attempts; yea, for diſcretion to order his Civil Affairs, as becomes a <hi>Man</hi> and a <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet he is diligent, not ſlothful in buſineſs, but fervent in Spirit, ſerving not his Worldly Intereſt, but the Lord; <hi>that is,</hi> he waits on the Providence of God, in the uſe of Lawful Means, committing the ſucceſs to Divine Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nediction.</p>
               <p>He will not lean to his own natural Sagacity, or prudential management of his Affairs. He quiets his Paſſions under all diſappointments. He ſeeks a ſanctified improvement of all Loſſes and Croſſes. If he proſper he aſcribes his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs to Gods Fatherly Care, Wiſdom and Love; he improves it to his Glory, in the promoting of his Chriſtian <hi>Religious</hi> Courſe.

               <p>So, the <hi>flowing</hi> in of the Worlds proſperity, hath proved the Death of the Soul <hi>Godward,</hi> and ſtifled all real deſires, after the Life and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Religion.

                  <hi>As a Dream when one awakes, ſo O Lord, thou wilt deſpiſe their Image,</hi> Pſ. 73.20.</p>
               <p>The Repreſentation which a Dream makes, ſeems very brisk, lively, and pleaſant; yet when we <hi>reflect</hi> upon it, with our waking thoughts we find it confuſed, and impertinent to our eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Happineſs, becauſe nothing remains, but the fiction of a Dream, the ſhadow <hi>of a</hi> ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow.</p>
               <p>Thus, that moſt <hi>ſtately</hi> Repreſentation of their Proſperity; by which, they conceit an Hope to be had in everlaſting remembrance, proves at moſt, but as a fond, fooliſh Puppet-Play.</p>

               <p>This cannot be laſting and effectual to <hi>Cure</hi> the Paroxyſms of inward Luſting, becauſe 'tis

               <p>The Body is the Souls Aſs, which will no longer be able to carry it, than you allow it fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Fodder.</p>

               <p>This is far from making Proviſion for the Fleſh, to fulfil the Luſts thereof.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> who beat down his Body, who gave it Club-Law, the Black and Blew Eye, that it might not caſt an Amorous wanton Glance, to court ſenſual Vanities; <hi>yet,</hi> knew how to obſerve a fit moderation in it.</p>

               <p>Pride uſually ſprings up from the Root of ſuch bitterneſs againſt the <hi>harmleſs</hi> ſupport of Nature: Popiſh Severities <hi>fatten</hi> Luſts, while they ſtarve the Body; and while Men thus <hi>threaten</hi> to ſtub up their inordinate deſires, they water their Root the more, by a ſecret comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with them.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Irregular</hi> Zeal, blazes like <hi>Moſes</hi> Buſh, in a <hi>threatning</hi> of Mens Luſts; yet there is no heat of a juſt Revenge which may quite conſume them.</p>
               <p>Sinners deceive and more <hi>pollute</hi> their Souls by falſe Counterfeit, un-Scriptural Arts, and Rules of weaning.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Another ſort of Sinners not <hi>really</hi> wean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed are <hi>ſuch,</hi> who being twitcht and bitten with the Worm of Conſcience, have a falſe Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite raiſed towards the Bread of Life.</p>
               <p>Thus the <hi>Capernaits</hi> cryed out in a tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Paſſion, Lord! evermore give us of this Bread.</p>

               <p>And <hi>Marcella</hi> in the Croud of Chriſt's Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, brake out into this exſtatical Applauſe, Bleſt is the Womb which bare thee!</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Such</hi> are not weaned from the Love of their Luſts, who <hi>commend the</hi> Preacher, that they may be excuſed from being <hi>commanded</hi> by <hi>that</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, which he preſſes upon them for Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience unto Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Others have too groſs and carnal a conceit of Spiritual Ordinances, who think theſe appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to allay the ſharp bitings of an inflamed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulcerated Conſcience, while they ſin preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly.</p>
               <p>By immoderate Belchings and ſtretching of their Appetite after Worldly, flatulent, crude Joys, they eject and Vomit up the good juice of the Word, and other Ordinances, which ſhould nouriſh their Souls to Eternal Life.</p>
               <p>But if they do not puke and keck at the wholſom Food of Divine Truth; yet there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains a <hi>Lipothymia</hi> or general faintneſs and fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure of true affection, which <hi>chills</hi> all endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours after a Heavenly Converſation, by too great Evacuations of that Spiritual nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which before was taken down.</p>
               <p>Hence the ſolid parts of Chriſtianity are diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated and melt away; ſo that the means of Grace which ſhould allay their hunger toward the World, become unprofitable. This proves fatal, becauſe ſinners eaſily deceive themſelves
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:48772:38"/>with this Diſtemper, as if it were a genuine hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger toward the Ordinances.</p>
               <p>The Word Preacht may raiſe ſtrains of great Joy in the hearing; yet, the heart not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed, nor ſubdued to Chriſt's weaning Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline. Sucking Children, have their ſmiles at their own pretty Fancies; yet are not able to act their Reaſon, in any reflection upon the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Deception of thoſe Imaginations. Phrentick ſinners may Cant it in Religious Notions, which is but a falſe conception of Spiritual Joy; becauſe it is only a tranſient paſſion raiſed from the briskneſs of the animal Spirits, which fly up into the head, yet infeeble afterwards the Executive faculties of the Soul, becauſe they have no tendency to produce a ſiricter courſe of Life.</p>
               <p>Culinary fire may ſcorch more than Elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary; yet this, by a more Vital kindly heat, beſt conſerves health, and ripens Fruits.</p>
               <p>So, violent ſudden paſſions in ſinners, may tranſport them beyond the ordinary rank of Chriſtians, in ſome extraordinary ſervices, and ſufferrings; yet ſuch ſeeming Zealots are ſo far from being weaned by ſelf-denial, that they were never ſenſible of the proper and real diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which introduce the form of a New-Cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Another ſort in the contrary extreme, are the <hi>Devils</hi> weanlings. I mean ſuch, who <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend</hi>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:48772:39"/>to be Comprehenſors in the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> State, and to have arrived at <hi>perfection</hi> in Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>Theſe are really poſſeſt with a Dumb and Deaf Spirit; they neither pray for Pardon of ſin, nor attend on any Goſpel-Miniſtry, becauſe out of Pride, Curioſity, Fancy, and Self-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, they preſume they have Graſpt the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Divine Wiſdom as a Monopoly to themſelves.</p>
               <p>How are ſuch deluded, being ſenſual, and not having the Spirit of Chriſt, whom they <hi>pretend to only.</hi> Let ſuch know, that a State of Spiritual weaning, doth not infer a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of Goſpel-Ordinances; it rather increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes a genuine, ſtrong Affection in hungring and thirſting after them.</p>
               <p>The weaned Saint forſakes not his proper Spiritual Food for Wind and Traſh; but rather renews more earneſt deſires after the ſincere Milk of the Word of Righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p>He lives not a ſeparated Life from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of Saints; only, he exchanges his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Diet, which was the Duſt of the Serpent, for more ſolid and refined nouriſhment.</p>
               <p>He forſakes not the firſt Principles in Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, as contemptible Milk for Babes, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds to grow in Grace, and in the Knowledg of God in Chriſt.</p>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:48772:39"/>
               <p>This more humbles and meekens him toward his Fellow-Saints, by Self-denial. It makes him more Holy, and Heavenly, more eſtranged from the World, and the Vanities of it.</p>
               <p>Like <hi>David,</hi> he is <hi>driven</hi> into the Wilderneſs, he doth not <hi>chuſe</hi> to want publick Ordinances. When he <hi>doth;</hi> his Soul even <hi>then</hi> pants after the Living-God, he thirſts with a more reſtleſs, ſtrong and impatient appetite, to ſee the Lords Power and Glory, ſo as he had injoyed him in the Sanctuary.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Sort of ſinners not weaned, are broken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winded, and impatient Suiters for Relief in their diſtreſs. Such are not prevailed with, to give Chriſt the quiet and full poſſeſſion of their hearts in an univerſal Dominion over them, becauſe they are <hi>not</hi> content that he ſhould ſpeed or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay, grant or deny their deſires.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were counted eſtranged from God, becauſe they waited not for his Counſels, neither were ſtedfaſt in his Covenant. While the Lords diſpenſations pleaſed them, they ſang his praiſes. What a ſtrong Rock, what a pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Redeemer had they to befriend them!</p>
               <p>Yet, let him try their Patience in <hi>ſuſpending</hi> his help, how ſoon do they forget the wonders of his hand, grow weary of his conduct, ſuſpect his care and faithfulneſs, reproach him, and fall to their old hank of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring.</p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:48772:40"/>
               <p>But a Saint truly weaned, doth not Antedate Divine Promiſes, nor ſlack his own purpoſes of Obedience. He doth not anticipate delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, nor with a ſhort-winded impatient pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhneſs, ſnatch a Mercy out of the hand of the Lord, before he be willing to beſtow it.</p>
               <p>Our mouths muſt not water after the forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Fruit of Sin, nor after the overhaſty fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of any Promiſe.</p>
               <p>Raw Fruit breeds Worms in Children.</p>
               <p>Not to wait ſilently for the Ripening of deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, is the ready way to blaſt it, or to anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate it with a Curſe.</p>
               <p>Even <hi>Manna</hi> over-eagerly hoorded up ſtank; and ſuddenly became as much loathed as it was impatiently longed for. Had <hi>Jacob</hi> (as plain a Man as he was) been thorowly weaned from Self-ſeeking and Unbelief, he had never attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have ſnatcht at the Promiſe, while the Fruit hung unripe upon it, nor to have foreſtal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Bleſſing of his Father, by the diſguize of an Artificial Lye.</p>
               <p>A weaned Saint, <hi>(ſo far as ſuch)</hi> will not turn aſide to crooked ways and unlawful ſhifts, to accompliſh his deſign.</p>
               <p>Faith doth not ſet a Man upon prepoſterous Courſes.</p>
               <p>Therefore let none pretend to truſt in God's Promiſes, while they make void his Laws.</p>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:48772:40"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>That</hi> is an Orthodox Regular Faith, which ſo bears Witneſs to the Truth of the Promiſe, that it will not betray the Truſt of <hi>Duty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is Power and Wiſdom enough in the Womb of every Divine Promiſe, to bring it ſelf to the Birth, without the Midwifery of any ſinful expedients, or excentrical practices to <hi>uphold</hi> the Lords fidelity by our diſſimulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>Therefore a weaned Frame doth not only produce a <hi>Working, Suffering</hi> and <hi>Abſtaining</hi> Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence from the forbidden Fruit of Sin; but alſo an Expecting, <hi>Waiting</hi> Patience, in order to reap, when <hi>Ripe,</hi> the Bleſſing of every delayed Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</p>
               <p>A weaned Saint, had rather have the Boon which he asks denied, than croſs the <hi>Rule</hi> in asking. He is more troubled if his deſires prove <hi>Inordinate,</hi> than that the Lord takes no <hi>Order</hi> to ſpeed and gratifie them.</p>
               <p>He is very full and pregnant with holy deſires, yet his Importunity doth not juſtle out his Modeſty. He is a ſelf-denying Supplicant, his deſires are neither peremptory nor impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent.</p>
               <p>He will lie at Heaven-Gate, though Relief do not haſten to him.</p>
               <p>He eſteems an heart made willing and able to <hi>wait,</hi> as a Mercy equal to <hi>that</hi> he waits for. And indeed, it is <hi>part</hi> of an Anſwer as well
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:48772:41"/>as a <hi>Pledg</hi> of gratifying his Requeſt.</p>

               <p>There is a falſe quietneſs, or ſilence of Spirit under Croſs diſappointments and ſufferrings, which differs very much from the generous <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine</hi> Submiſſion, and Acquieſcency of a wean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Saint.</p>

               <p>Faith welcoms Afflictions as good Angels ſent for its Inſtruction, becauſe they Cure our ſinful Surfeits, and Bleed us in the Maſter-Vein.</p>
               <p>A weaned Saint, counts himſelf leſs than the leaſt of Divine Mercies, even below the Lords condeſcention to <hi>Correct</hi> him.</p>
               <p>He will joyn, and take part with God againſt his own Intereſt and Enjoyments.</p>
               <p>Yea, he rejoyceth in the Lord abſtractedly for himſelf, when he is ſtript naked of all Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Comforts.</p>
               <p>A ſupernatural Patience can rejoyce in Bonds, ſing in Priſon, Glory in Tribulation, Triumph in Sufferings, and count it ſelf exalted in the deepeſt abaſement for Righteouſneſs ſake.</p>
               <p>A Real Chriſtian maintains a Conſiſtency in the tranquillity of his Mind, while he Ploughs the Waves of every amazing Providence, with the ſteedy Helm of an Heroick Faith, guided by the Pole-Star of the Word of God.</p>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:48772:42"/>
               <p>He is anointed with the Spirit of Holineſs as a Son of Peace, therefore he murmurs not. Thus, Oyle aſſwages the Tempeſtuous Raging of the Sea.</p>
               <p>His Faith works by Love, and <hi>this</hi> puts a <hi>good</hi> Conſtruction on every Divine Chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>But now the Hypocrite who ſeems weaned by ſubmiſſiveneſs in ſuffering, ſets a demure Countenance on a froward Heart.</p>
               <p>His Patience is (moſt-what) ſelfiſh and thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trical, to gain the Reputation of a Generous and Heroick Mind.</p>
               <p>Yet, out of deſperate preſumption he courts Death, as the only Refuge of his Cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe:</p>
               <p>The Hypocrite ſtudies his Hearts-eaſe in his ſeeming Patience. He well knows that a Bird by fluttering draws the ſnare the ſtraiter upon it ſelf, that a Fellon who attempts to break Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is loaded with a heavier Chain, that the ſtubborn Child by fretting and kicking, gets no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but more ſtinging Laſhes.</p>

<pb n="67" facs="tcp:48772:42"/>He can eſpy a bright Lamp of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in the midſt of the ſmoaking Furnace; Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney in the Carcaſe of a Lion; <hi>Halcyon</hi>-days in a Storm, and is aſſured that of Thorns he ſhall gather Grapes, and <hi>fetch</hi> Meat, the hid Manna of Divine Conſolation, out of the Eater of ſome waſting devouring providence.</p>
               <p>The Hypocrite may pretend to ſome degree of <hi>Softneſs</hi> of heart, while ſcorcht by Affliction; yet, he ſoon returns to the folly of ſin, and diſcontent at his ſufferings; As the Fleſh of a Peacock Roaſted, turns Raw again after a few hours Reſervation.</p>
               <p>(On the contrary) the magnanimous pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of a weaned Saint, being inſuperable is not <hi>ſtinted,</hi> nor ordinarily <hi>Ruffled</hi> or diſcompo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the ſevereſt ſequeſtration of his neareſt and deareſt Earthly Joys.</p>
               <p>His Faith can divorce the heart from the Heart, the renewed part of a Chriſtian from the Carnal, and make the Soul forget its wont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Acts of exceſs, in the <hi>Fond</hi> ſallyings out of his Affections to the Creature.</p>
               <p>All the uſe of mourning for the want or loſs of Worldly accommodations, is only <hi>This,</hi> to revenge himſelf on his Luſts, which he made the Idols of his heart.</p>
               <p>He knows, that ſighs are too Spiritual a blaſt to be ſpent on any thing but his Sins.</p>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:48772:43"/>
               <p>Being fixt in the admiration of the Lords infinite excellencies, no Worldly loſs or gain can divert his intire Communion with the Fountain of pure Joy.</p>
               <p>Thus, he ſtains not his Chriſtian profeſſion with any ſullen Tears in a Low afflicted ſtate; nor is tranſported with fond delights, in an High-eſtate. For he well conſiders that it is from the ſame Love, that the Lord ſtrikes and ſtroaks a Saint.</p>
               <p>Thus, his Faith can turn an Hell of deep diſquietment in <hi>Senſe,</hi> into an Heaven of Joy and Triumph.</p>
               <p>A weaned Saint highthens his contentment to a <hi>thankful</hi> Spirit for Afflictions, as happy op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of Improving a Gracious Frame.</p>
               <p>This thankfulneſs is conjoyned with a Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, to hold faſt his Integrity, though the Lord ſmite him into the place of Dragons, and cover him with the ſhaddow of Death.</p>
               <p>Yea, a weaned Saint is quickened to become more Active in Obedience, by how much the more he is depreſt in grievous exigencies and diſtreſſes.</p>
               <p>Thus the Ball ſtruck with the Racket re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds the higher: The Vine being pruned, bleeds not to death, but weeps it ſelf into great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Fruitfulneſs.</p>
               <p>Again, a Saint Cenſures not the Lords wean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Methods before the Reſult and winding up of the deſign.</p>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:48772:43"/>
               <p>When the Lord fires him out of all his Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly injoyments, yet he knows that the good will of the Lord dwells in the Buſh, to make it flouriſh in the midſt of the conſuming Flames.</p>
               <p>Therefore ſays he, it is good to draw nigh to the Holy One, when his Diſpenſations are moſt dreadful and ſevere.</p>
               <p>Thus his Faith informs and aſſures him, that he can as little want the Diſcipline of the Croſs, as an Heavenly Inheritance.</p>
               <p>That by deep and heavy Tryals, the Lord ſtamps a Badg of honour upon him, accounting him to be his Champion and a reſolute defender of the Faith of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thus weaned Saints quiet themſelves under all their diſtreſſes, yea Triumph in the Croſs of Chriſt as the top of their felicity and the Creſt of their preferment.</p>

               <p>For the <hi>Former,</hi> this is a deep tryal of ſelf. denial, when an Injunction is put on a perſon, the dutiful obſervance of which ſeems to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict</hi> Duty.

               <p>Some are commanded becauſe <hi>precedently</hi> good in their own Nature, as to love God for himſelf, to hate ſin as an unnatural Act to a Mans ſelf. <hi>Moral</hi> Duties are generally and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally known by the very Light of <hi>Nature;</hi> and are grounded in their neceſſity and

               </p>
               <p>As Saints will impoſe no Laws in <hi>Divine</hi> concernments upon themſelves, as abſolutely neceſſary: ſo they are very cautious in abſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from all <hi>the</hi> occaſions &amp; appearances of evil.

They are troubled for an impure Dream and will not ſpeculate the leaſt iniquity, ſo much as in their fancy.</p>
               <p>Alſo, they are <hi>Curious</hi> about the leaſt Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance of every Action, that it be done for Manner, Meaſure, Time, and Place, to a right End, and in a due Order and Decorum. <hi>Moſes and Noah</hi> in erecting the Tabernacle &amp; Ark were in every Circumſtance directed and limited by Divine appointment.

               <p>But Hypocrits <hi>make Laws</hi> and impoſe ſeveri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties on themſelves, as <hi>pleaſing</hi> Bonds, whereas Chriſt's Laws are <hi>Yokes</hi> and pinching Fetters, which they ſtrive to diſſolve, and break away from.</p>
               <p>This ſhews, they are not weaned from an opinion of ſelf-ſuperintendency, and the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of their Carnal Wiſdom.</p>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:48772:46"/>
               <p>The great Conteſt 'twixt God and Sinners is, <hi>whoſe</hi> Will ſhall ſtand for a Law &amp; Rule in the Ordering out of their Affections and Actions.</p>
               <p>Yet <hi>our</hi> Wills are too big and head-ſtrong for our blinded corrupt underſtandings to Govern. Hence we are guided by no <hi>fixt</hi> ſtrict Rule, but hurried by Pride and Paſſion, iſſuing from our darkned and miſtaken apprehenſions of the <hi>chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt</hi> good.</p>
               <p>Therefore, we had need be weaned from ſelf-Supremarcy, that we may be directed ſafely, according to the Wiſdom of God revealed in the written Word, and not led by Fancy, or the impulſes of a private Spirit. For we eaſily are induced to believe <hi>that</hi> Lawful, neceſſary, and commendable, which we have a mind to in gratifying our Luſts, or advancing our World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Intereſt.</p>
               <p>But, in a truly weaned Frame of Submiſſion to <hi>all</hi> God's Laws, in every Circumſtance, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts our true Liberty, Safety, Wiſdom, and <hi>Magnanimity</hi> of Spirit. Otherwiſe we ſhall ſoon become Captives to Satan, and our Luſts.</p>
               <p>Moraliſts and Hypocrits may proceed far in a courſe of Obedience; and yet not be truly weaned, becauſe not thorowly brought off from the Dictates of Carnal Reaſon, to ſubſcribe <hi>only</hi> to the Lords good Will and Pleaſure, in order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out the minuteſt Circumſtances of their Actions.</p>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:48772:47"/>
               <p>The <hi>ſtrength</hi> of Wiſdom and <hi>ſincerity</hi> of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is ſeen moſt, in a ſtrict Obſervance of <hi>all due</hi> Circumſtances. <hi>Theſe</hi> many times a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to more conſiderable weight in the Lords account, than either the <hi>matter</hi> of Duty, or of Sin.</p>
               <p>Therefore, <hi>David</hi> prays, <hi>Order my ſteps in</hi> thy <hi>Word,</hi> as cautiouſly and curiouſly, as they who climb Rocks, or dance upon a Rope.</p>
               <p>How ſeverely hath the Lord puniſht an Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, or failure in the very <hi>Circumſtance</hi> of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand?

               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:48772:47"/>
               <p>A weaned Saint is <hi>Cautious</hi> about the leaſt Sin, and very <hi>Curious</hi> about the leaſt Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of a Duty.

               <p>Yet how did theſe Hypocrits profeſs a <hi>weaned</hi> Frame, in <hi>Jer.</hi> 42. Whether the Lords An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer be good or evil; (<hi>Politically</hi> they mean, and not morally) yet, we will obey, though to our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience and diſadvantage.</p>
               <p>So <hi>that</hi> perſon (in 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 20.35, 36, 37.) was more nicely and <hi>ſuperſtitiouſly</hi> Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, <hi>than</hi> truly reſpectful to the Prophet who refuſed to wound him by a <hi>Divine</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion: therefore he was ſlain by a Lion, not becauſe he had a <hi>Cowards</hi> heart, but for his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Sanctity, and the ſcrupuloſity of an Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite.</p>
               <p>So that weaned Saints do not Judg of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity or neceſſity of Divine Commands, by outward <hi>appearance</hi> to their Carnal Reaſon, but readily obey their Commiſſion when they eſpy the ſtamp and warrant of <hi>Divine</hi> Authority, though the matter, or Circumſtance of the Command, ſeem unreaſonable and ridiculous.
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:48772:48"/>Yea, lie <hi>Croſs</hi> to their perſonal Reputation and Worldly Intereſt.</p>

               <p>By theſe deſpicable Babes and Sucklings did the Lord ordain ſtrength to ſtill or ſtop the Mouths of the Enemy, the Atheiſt and Aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, <hi>viz.</hi> the perſecutors of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>By theſe weanlings, the Lord confounded the Carnal Wiſdom of the chiefeſt Philoſophers and Politicians among the Gentile Nations.</p>
               <p>They only carried forth the Light and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Goſpel in Earthen Veſſels, in frail Bodies, the very breaking of which by perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, cauſed the ſound and ſame of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy to ſcatter the darkneſs of Satans King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and confound the rage of all their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
               <p>So ſtrong and Victorious are Bulruſhes in the hand of Omnipotency, to gain a Conqueſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the powers of Hell.</p>

               <p>Yea, they muſt ſubmit themſelves to the Cure and Conduct of the Spirit of Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: In both which Reſpects he is ſtiled the Spirit of <hi>Judgment</hi> and of Burning; to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume all Self-Arrogance, which truſts in, and boaſts of a Self-Righteouſneſs, as well as to purge out all the Reliques of ſenſual, fond, foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Affections to defiling Luſts, and the inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate overvaluing of Creature-Comforts and Enjoyments.</p>
               <p>Otherwiſe, there is no true weaning by the Spirit of Holineſs, but only the ſweeping and Garniſhing of a rotten Sepulchre, into which, <hi>ſtanding empty,</hi> the unclean Spirit will re-enter, and more confirm his Title, without any Fear of a real diſpoſſeſſion. Luſts, by moral Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions may be diſturbed, and not ſo often Rant and Rave as formerly, by the preſent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraints of a civilized Temper and Diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>Such ſober <hi>Phrenſie,</hi> as 'tis leſs ſuſpected, ſo 'tis more hardly cured, becauſe miſtaken for the perfect Recovery of the Sinner, to a right Frame of Mind.</p>
               <p>How hard is it to Convince Phariſaical Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and Self-Juſticiaries, of the neceſſity of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, to <hi>lead</hi> a true va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid Title to Eternal Life; Or to lay proſtrate their Spiritual priding of themſelves in the tinkling of their own Imaginary Excellencies!</p>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:48772:50"/>
               <p>It's uſual for Frantick ſinners, to pleaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in their Crazy Fancy, and ſtrongly to imagine, that they Reign as Kings over their impetuous Luſts; when-as they are deeper poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt by, and inſlaved unto them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That</hi> Hectick Fever, which lurks within, and preys upon the Vital Spirits is moſt dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous. So is formality the bane of ſound Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. Slight Profeſſors of Chriſtianity ſport themſelves with their maſquing Mock-ſhowes in a pretended Reformation. Such are not true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly weaned from Luſts, and the Love of the World, to Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Therefore at laſt their Surfeit breaks out to a loathing of the very form of Godlineſs, becauſe they deſpiſed and denied the power.</p>
               <p>It is not a Cynical, ſullen Raillery at the Worlds Treachery and adulterate Beauty which can alienate our Hearts from an Amorous pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of it; unleſs True Grace ſubdue our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to admire it.</p>
               <p>Concupiſcence cannot be extinguiſht, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verpoized, but only by the Intenſer flame of a Chaſt Love to God for himſelf, as the Eſſence and perfection of our Happineſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This</hi> is Real Evangelical weaning, when the Pride of our Carnal Wiſdom, the ſtubbornneſs of our perverſe Wills, and the <hi>Exorbitancy</hi> of our wild humorſom Affections, are deaded by the power of Chriſts Death, and the Lovely Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a Crucified Jeſus.</p>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:48772:51"/>
               <p>Yea, the Life of Jeſus muſt be made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt in our mortified Body, to Eclipſe all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-Excellencies that we may be quickned to a Life of <hi>Sole</hi>-dependency upon the Lord's Alſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency, to influence the Soul in the Vigorous purſuit of all Relative Duties toward God and Man.</p>
               <p>A truly weaned Frame, is no other than the Judicious <hi>Elective</hi> State of every Regenerate Perſon.</p>
               <p>This flows from <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> with Chriſt by Faith.</p>
               <p>This obliges to Heart-purity and Chaſtity; not to caſt the leaſt wanton Glance toward the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filing Vanities of the World.</p>
               <p>Beſides, the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction</hi> of Chriſt's Spirit works in truely-weaned Perſons, a Sanctified Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whereby they can make a right, and due eſtimation of Perſons and <hi>Things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore, ſuch cannot conform to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates of Carnal Reaſon, nor inebriate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the Cares and Pleaſures of a Senſual Life.</p>
               <p>Such being Renewed by Gracious Principles, their hearts and Affections are ſet <hi>Right;</hi> the bent and poize of their deſires is carried out to prove and delight only, where God himſelf doth.</p>
               <p>Saints are weaned, becauſe the Son of God hath made in their behalf, a compleat Conqueſt over the World, in all its <hi>diſſembling</hi> Artifices, affrighting <hi>Menaces,</hi> bewitching Allurements
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:48772:51"/>and Temptations. As he hath <hi>won</hi> it, ſo he will <hi>Maintain</hi> it, in all <hi>ſuch,</hi> who being Born of God, aſpire to a <hi>Divine</hi> Generoſity, and Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity of Spirit; to follow the ſteps and exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of their great General and Redeemer.</p>
               <p>For a truly-weaned Frame, though it ariſe from Faith in Chriſt, working Self-emptineſs and Self-Abaſement, yet it grows up to a Holy-ſtatelineſs of Spirit, whereby the renewed Soul grows coy to all Temptations which ſtudy to defile its Virgin-Chaſtity.</p>
               <p>This is that <hi>Spouſe</hi>-like Girdle, whereby the Chriſtian is kept cleaving to the Lord's Alſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency for him, to conſtitute the Eſſence of true happineſs.</p>
               <p>The Lord <hi>alone</hi> is the Foundation of his weanlings future <hi>Hopes</hi> and preſent <hi>Comforts;</hi> For, being United to him by Faith, they cleave to him as the Center of their Love and Delight; deriving all their ſatisfaction from his infinite and moſt amiable perfections.</p>
               <p>Thus Faith and Self-denial, are the two main <hi>Poles,</hi> on which, the whole weight of Chriſtian Religion depends; and the Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal improvement of it, turns it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Hereby, we are demonſtrated, to be truly weaned or mortified, when all Self-arrogance or Confidence in our own Righteouſneſs is reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and the Creature becomes <hi>Nullified,</hi> that Chriſt alone may be Magnified as all in all, to
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:48772:52"/>compleat our Eternal Happineſs. To which muſt be added, an Univerſal, Free, and Chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Reſignation of our whole Man, to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of Chriſt's Word and Spirit.</p>
               <p>Natural Carnal Men are only pretenders unto this Frame of heart; whatever ſpecious ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances thereof, they may hold forth in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſtrictneſs of their Converſation.</p>
               <p>For is it poſſible that perſons ſhould Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lically be weaned by ſolid Converſion to the Lord; and yet deſpiſe, or oppoſe the genuine inſeparable effects of it?</p>
               <p>Without the power of Godlineſs, of which Self-denial is the Spring or Soul; there can be no thorow eſtrangement from the Love of Luſts, or the Allurements of Worldly Vanities.</p>
               <p>Therefore, to <hi>beget,</hi> increaſe, and maintain a weaned Frame of heart; I ſhall lay down theſe following Rules.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Rules to become truely weaned.</head>
               <p n="1">1. Take heed of abuſing Chriſtian Liberty in the immoderate Uſe of things Lawful.</p>
               <p>Thus Chriſt adviſed his very Apoſtles, though weaned to a very high Degree, in forſaking all things to teſtifie their ſincerity, in imbracing the Chriſtian Inſtitution: Take heed leſt your hearts be overcharged with ſurfeiting an the Cares of this Life.</p>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:48772:52"/>
               <p>Commonly, we fear not a Snare in thoſe Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodations which the Lord of the Creation allows us, for our refreſhment in our Pilgrimage.</p>
               <p>Theſe muſt not prove as the Fruit of the <hi>Lote-Tree</hi> to ſome Travellers, to make us forget our <hi>Divine</hi> Original, our Heavenly Country, while we ſing the Worlds Tune in a <hi>ſtrange</hi> Land, <hi>viz. What ſhall we Eat, Drink, or where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſhall we be Cloathed?</hi> never caring to return to the Boſome of God, as our Reſt and proper Center.</p>
               <p>Remember <hi>Siſera's</hi> Fate, when the World <hi>Jael</hi>-like hath made us drunk with ſecular Cares and ſecured us in its Tent by groſs ſtupidity; it diſcovers its Courteſie to be full of Craft and Treachery: For, after an officious Indulgence, which will <hi>exceed</hi> our deſires in Kindneſs, it will drive home the Nail of ſelf-perplexing Fears and Sorrows, not only to our Head, but very Heart it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Thus, the <hi>Gnoſticks</hi> ſported themſelves with their own deceivings, while they pleaded Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Liberty, that the whole Creation was pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed by Chriſt, to maintain <hi>them,</hi> as the only Iluminated Ones, in all exceſs of riot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>Thus, they croſt the deſign of Goſpel-Grace which appeared to teach us to deny all ungodly Luſts, and to live Soberly, Righteouſly, and Godly in this preſent world.</p>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:48772:53"/>
               <p>Thus, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> pleaſes it ſelf ſo long in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing about the Candle, till it ſinges its Wings or conſumes it ſelf.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Take a true eſtimate of the Creature in its Natural Worth, rather than in that falſe Dreſs, which your Imagination tricks it up in; ſtrip all Earthly Vanities out of their deceitful Varniſh. For, Satan caſts a ſtrange Miſt before our Eyes, and perverts our Fancy, to make us miſerable by our own Conſent.</p>
               <p>Hence, we expect <hi>more</hi> from the Creature than it can yield in its moſt quinteſſential injoyment or ſublimated improvement. How many who ſuppoſe themſelves Rich in Grace, have World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Deſigns, as the Philoſophers Stone, beggared and made miſcrable! But weaned Saints are wary, and advertiſed of this Deluſion. They will make uſe of the World, but not truſt to it to make them happy. Therefore although they attain not that proſperity, which Worldlings ſeek; yet, in their way to true happineſs, they meet with (in their experience of the Worlds Vanity) many rare and choice diſcoveries of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Myſteries which they value before all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments of the whole Creation.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Study the <hi>Dignity</hi> of your precious im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Heaven-born Souls. Eſteem of World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y injoyments at preſent, as you will view and value them at Death, as you will find them to bear a <hi>Rate</hi> in the diſmal conflagration of
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:48772:53"/>the Univerſe. <hi>Then</hi> the World ſhall undergo the puniſhment of a Witch, for inchanting and deluding poor Mortals, who have loved Vanity, and truſted in the lying ſhadow of a tearing Bramble, to deſpiſe the true Vine and Olive, <hi>viz.</hi> the Sweetneſs of Chriſt, who can only yield us perfect ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Maintain a mortifying Frame of Self-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial, while you lie ſucking at the Breaſts of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity. Put ſuppoſitions to your ſelves as <hi>Habakkuk,</hi> of the Creatures <hi>failing</hi> you; That the fulneſs of its injoyment, may poſſibly be imbittered with a mixture of Vexation.</p>
               <p>So ſhall it not <hi>overlay</hi> your Hopes by diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment; nor will your ſelves <hi>overcloy</hi> and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit your affections with forbidden Fruit, in perverting of the true Uſe of Creature-Comforts and Enjoyments.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Do not count your Happineſs and Peace of mind, to lie in the <hi>Change</hi> of your outward condition, but get your dropſical Diſtemper Cured. The ſick Child may ſhift the Breaſt, and yet not be reduced to a quiet Frame, or vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous State, till it acquieſce in a <hi>Manly</hi> kind of Diet.</p>
               <p>Chriſtians, would you recover any <hi>Conſiſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> in your Spiritual State, and Souls-health? Then reſolve, not only to <hi>weep out</hi> your ſinful ſurfeits, but be content that the Lord ſhould bleed you in the <hi>Maſter-Vein.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:48772:54"/>
               <p>A <hi>Revulſion</hi> of your Feveriſh and Voracious deſires toward Creature-enjoyments, will puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Vital Affections of your Souls, by ſetling them on the Lord himſelf, in a due meaſure and Order. Yet afterward your ſelves muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to maintain a more ſtrict Diſcipline or Regiment over the Corrupt humors and fond fooliſh extravagancies of your deſires.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Eſteem not of <hi>that</hi> to be real Mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or a genuine weaning, which only deads Corruption yet flows not from a thorow Reno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the heart. Sinners may abſtain from their ſinful Surfeits, yet never abandon nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominate them.</p>
               <p>A thorow-weaned Frame is not the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of Godlineſs in the <hi>General,</hi> where the power is deſpiſed or hated; Nor is it the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning of Sin in general, or the <hi>groſſer</hi> Luſts of the Fleſh; though Men live in the allowance of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret ſins, and under the Dominion of ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, more retired, refined Acts of ſin. What is this, but to graft a new ſin on the ſtock of an old Luſt?</p>
               <p>All ſin grows deeper rooted and ingratiated by ſuch a cleaverly conveying out of ſight the <hi>chief favourite,</hi> faln into ſome <hi>diſgrace</hi> at preſent, rather than any true <hi>Diſguſt</hi> which ſeeks the utter deſtruction of it.</p>
               <p>A <hi>ſlight</hi> diſlike of ſin, truſted to, gives Satan a more quiet and deep poſſeſſion.</p>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:48772:54"/>
               <p>The ſinner may be weary of his Life, becauſe of the bitter <hi>effects</hi> of ſin, yet his heart is ſecretly eſpouſed to it.</p>
               <p>He may repent of his diſſembled ſeverity, and wiſh that himſelf may die, rather than that his corrupt <hi>inclination</hi> ſhould be pinion'd or put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to little eaſe.</p>
               <p>Rather ſtrive to break the heart of old <hi>Adam,</hi> to kill the very Root of an Helliſh-Nature; ſeek the deſtruction of whatſoever is <hi>diſguſtive</hi> to the Conſtitution of the new Creature, that there may be no more hope of reconciliation unto ſin, than of the meeting of Heaven and Hell together.</p>
               <p>Lay not down your ſins as Weapons at the Foot of God as a <hi>Conqueror,</hi> when you can no longer naintain the fight, but <hi>out of Loyalty</hi> execute them with your own hand.</p>
               <p>Caſt them not only away in a <hi>Fright,</hi> upon the Hue and Cry of your Conſcience, but pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue them to the Horns of the <hi>Altar,</hi> drag them thence, where they expect <hi>Protection,</hi> and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice them with chearfulneſs, otherwiſe they will mar and <hi>defeat</hi> all your Religious Services, and the hope of future Glory.</p>
               <p>Formaliſts deſcend to Hell, more <hi>unſuſpected<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> under the Garb of Religious <hi>Vows,</hi> and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere threats againſt their Luſts.</p>
               <p>Thus, ſome Parents in a ſhort Paſſion <hi>Rate</hi> their Children out of their ſight, when they
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:48772:55"/>have done a ſhrewd turn, yet they can immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately turn their Faces aſide and ſmile at their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky Wit, or after a ſhort time, cocker them the more.</p>
               <p>Satan as a cunning Spinſter, leaves on the Diſtaff of a depraved Nature, ſuch <hi>pretended</hi> good reſolutions, as a Lock of Wool, as a <hi>Pledg</hi> or advantage of future returning, to draw out the Web of Iniquity to a greater extenſion than before.</p>
               <p>Thus many Sinners purchaſe the Infamous Title of <hi>Sceptical Futuriſts</hi> in Repentance, as they prove themſelves to be <hi>Platonick Lovers</hi> of Vertue, only in ſpeculation. For their Vows of Reformation, muſt be interpreted as we read the Hebrew Dialect, altogether <hi>back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus, the more they tamper with, and ſtrain the Ruſty Wards of a diſſembling heart, with ſome falſe Key of <hi>ſlight</hi> Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the harder it will be to open to the Motions and convictions of Chriſts Spirit.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Improve weaning-Conſiderations, ſuch as theſe.</p>
               <p>That perſons of <hi>ſtrong</hi> and fond affections to Creature-enjoyments are uſually perſons of <hi>ſtrange</hi> and deep afflictions. It's thought that <hi>Abraham</hi> was toying and ſporting with <hi>Iſaac</hi> a little before the Command came to Sacrifice him.</p>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:48772:55"/>
               <p>Uſually we follow our Idolized Comforts to the Grave with Mourning; as <hi>Phaltiel</hi> did <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal</hi> to <hi>Bahurim,</hi> when <hi>Iſhboſheth</hi> ſnatcht her from him.</p>
               <p>When the Lord obſerves that we grow fond of Strangers, and familiar with the Worlds Temptations, he puts <hi>out</hi> the Candle of proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity, and Seals up the Star-Light of all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-Comforts, with which we have <hi>wantoniz'd</hi> in our fond admiration, that we may depend on <hi>Him Alone,</hi> as the God of our Light, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and Salvation.</p>
               <p>When a dark Night of Affliction <hi>Steals</hi> on us then we run home to neſtle in the Boſome of Divine-Alſufficiency, though we had our <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garies</hi> before, in Courting every forreign Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-Comfort to ſupport and gratify our fleſhly ſenſuality. <hi>I will go and return unto my place,</hi> that is, confine, and ſhut up my ſelf in Heaven; <hi>I will get me out of ſight and Call,</hi> that their weaning being apprehended more <hi>grievous,</hi> they may under the depth of their diſtreſs, ſeek me more early, and earneſtly <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 5.15.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>David,</hi> the Man after God's heart, was cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtened every Morning, becauſe when the Lord came to feel his Pulſe, <hi>how</hi> his Love and delight <hi>beat</hi> towards <hi>him,</hi> he found the Frame of his heart to vary and faulter. His very fleſh and heart failed, that he might <hi>cling</hi> the cloſer in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, <hi>Then, Whom have I in Heaven but Thee!</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:48772:56"/>
               <p>Thus <hi>Iſrael</hi> became <hi>Jezrael,</hi> the ſcattered Flock, and her weaning by Captivity, was in order to her betrothing.</p>
               <p>Some there are, whom neither ſmiles nor frowns, neither Blows nor Charms of Love will wean.</p>
               <p>Yet, it is more <hi>ingenuous</hi> to be eſtranged from our Luſts, by the Gracious and Spiritual ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances of the Lord, than by imbittering the Breaſts of the Creature, or forcing the Lord to put on the diſguize of an Enemy, to affright us. Uſually we will not be weaned, till we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Image of Death to ſit upon the Eye-lids of our deareſt Comforts.</p>
               <p>Make therefore a wiſe <hi>contemperament</hi> of Love and Fear in your own Souls; be won by the former, and awed by the latter. Fear may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as a rivetting Wedg, the firſt conteſt with our darling Luſts, but <hi>Love</hi> can only <hi>compleat</hi> the Conqueſt.</p>
               <p>A Child is weaned rather by ſinging to it, than by blows.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Be convinc'd of the Lords <hi>Love and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion</hi> in weaning you, then you will more chearfully comply with the ſevereſt method of eſtranging you from a fond neſtling in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom of any Luſt.</p>
               <p>The Lord's <hi>End</hi> is, that you may arrive to a <hi>maſculine</hi> State and Spirit in your Chriſtian courſe, that you may be fitted for more eminent ſervice.</p>

               <p>It is for our Spiritual advantage, that the Lord thus inſtructs us with ſeverity, by deſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, perſecution of Worldly Men, and the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Alarm of temptation; Therefore we ſhould <hi>ſuit</hi> our ſelves to him, we ſhould not be humorſome and diſcontented, at this neceſſary though bitter work.</p>

                  <hi>David</hi> complained, that the <hi>Sons of Zerviah</hi> were too hard for him, while he was newly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred on his regal power. But do you execute your Luſts, (as the <hi>Jews did Chriſt</hi>) early in the Morning?

               <p>It's diſſicult to pull up Weeds when the <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den is overgrown,</hi> and they have <hi>ſpread</hi> their Roots, by long neglect to clear the Ground.</p>
               <p>So is it to break off a ſetled long confirmed habit in Vice.

               <p>Many times, we beg the fulneſs of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to our own deſtruction, at leaſt, againſt the <hi>Comfort</hi> of our Life; when the Lord Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and Blaſts it, or croſſes us by it; though we do not forfeit our Intereſt in God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>

               <p>For though the Lord give us all things libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally to enjoy; yet, it is with this reſerved Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation, that we ſhould enjoy God in the Creature, and the Creature for God.</p>

This proves fatal, when the Soul grows Dropſical, and impetuous in its deſires; crying out, as <hi>Rachel, Give me Children, or I dye.</hi> When as ravenous <hi>Harpies,</hi> we will adventure to ſnatch any Worldly accommodation out of the hand of God <hi>without,</hi> or <hi>againſt</hi> his Will, and Conſent;</p>

               <p n="7">7. You muſt diſtinguiſh 'twixt an <hi>indifferent</hi> mutable delight, becauſe the Creature in its own Nature is tranſient and periſhing, and a reſolute <hi>fixt</hi> delight, which terminates in it, as the Center of ſatisfaction.</p>

               <p>A Carnal heart which deſignes to be Rich, will dive and digg as low as <hi>Hell,</hi> to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the <hi>Stygian</hi> Lake, for the ingroſſing of Golden Sands: But a Spiritual heart refers it ſelf to <hi>God's</hi> allowance, in theſe temporal Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.

               <p>Indeed, the Bed is too ſhort, and the Cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too narrow, to wrap up our Contentment in it.</p>
               <p>Earthly things are my Proviſions in the way to <hi>Canaan,</hi> but not a ſutable, ſufficient Portion to make me happy.</p>

               <p>The former Diſpenſation, gives only a <hi>Civil</hi> Right unto our Enjoyments, but the latter, San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifies and improves the <hi>true</hi> Uſe of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for the Lord's honour, and our Spiritual advantage.</p>
               <p>Therefore, if we would keep our hearts in a weaned Frame, let us bound and moderate our affections to the <hi>Beſt</hi> of Creatures; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, we ſhall diſcover an <hi>Impotency</hi> in Grace, if not a <hi>Nullity.</hi>

               <p>But weaned Chriſtians, while they paſs tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row variety of Creature-Delights are not ſo prone to be raviſht from the <hi>Contemplation</hi> of the Chiefeſt Good.</p>
               <p>They loſe not the exquiſiteneſs of their Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Sagacity, neither do they admiringly dote on ſublunary Profits and Pleaſures, nor neglect to pour out the ſtrength of their Love and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light on the Lord of the Creation, as the only <hi>Center</hi> of true felicity and ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>Every Man hath ſome delightful Object or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to which he <hi>ſacrifices</hi> his time, and the ſtrength of his Affections, as to a Deity.</p>
               <p>In this Sence, we ſhould make the <hi>Lord our Delight,</hi> that we may ſay with <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 73.25. <hi>Whom have I in Heaven but thee? and there is none on Earth, whom I deſire in Compariſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Spiritual Delight in the Lord contains not only the ſerious Contemplation of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Excellencies in their <hi>ſuitableneſs</hi> to our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and future State of Happineſs; whereby, a reſtleſs Deſire to enjoy Union and Communion with God, in and thorow Chriſt, is begotten; but delight is the higheſt ſtep or Degree of Love, whereby a Soul weaned from Luſts and
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:48772:71"/>the World, Reſts fully ſatisfyed in the choice of the Lord for its Portion and Pattern.</p>
               <p>Thus, <hi>that Witchcraft</hi> which Creature-Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties faſtned on the Affections is taken off; by the more powerful Charm of Divine Love; and Mans beſotted deſires are reduced in ſome good Degree to their Original <hi>Liberty, Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> and <hi>Purity;</hi> by fixing them on the Baſis of true Felicity.</p>
               <p>For, who could deſire <hi>more</hi> happineſs, than to have a permiſſion to delight in the Lord, who <hi>of</hi> and <hi>in</hi> himſelf is Sole,-and Al-ſufficient for his own infinite Contemplation and Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Here</hi> weaned Souls may be ſwallowed up in admiration, by a Conſtant, bound leſs tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent Delight. <hi>Here</hi> alone is perfect ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, ſo as to look out no <hi>farther</hi> for true felicity.</p>
               <p>To make up this Delight, there are all its In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients Eſſentially in the Lord.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Reality of Worth. 2. Variety of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies. 3. Sutability to the Soul. 4. Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency to give Satisfaction, and a ſolid Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manency.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Reality of matchleſs Worth. Therefore, it is folly and madneſs in ſinners, ſo to obſerve any lying Vanity, which hath but a ſhadow of Beauty, as to neglect or contemn the chiefeſt Good, which is the <hi>Idea</hi> and <hi>Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> of all Perfection.</p>
               <pb n="126" facs="tcp:48772:72"/>
               <p n="2">2. In <hi>the Lord</hi> alone, abſiractedly conſidered from all Creatures, are all Excellencies Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nentially and tranſcendently, without any <hi>Compoſition, Multiplication,</hi> or <hi>Diviſion.</hi> For himſelf is One Single, Intire, Abſolute, and Infinite Perfection; without <hi>Variety</hi> or <hi>Variati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet <hi>ſhallow</hi> Mortals, nay glorified Saints and Angels, cannot conceive of this Infinite Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction without forming <hi>diſtinct, ſucceſſive</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of the Divine Eſſence. For <hi>that</hi> Excellency which is in God, is not preſented <hi>all at once.</hi> The ſublimeſt, and pureſt <hi>Seraphim</hi> cannot mount up to him, to get any <hi>compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive</hi> diſcoveries of that Divine Beauty and Glory which ſo <hi>transformingly,</hi> irradiates, and <hi>tranſcendently</hi> Conſtitutes them in an eſtate of Happineſs.</p>
               <p>This is the Reaſon, why glorified Saints and Angels are conſtantly and immutably delighted in God; becauſe, himſelf being the <hi>Eſſential</hi> Object of their ſatisfaction, is Eternally <hi>One and the Same.</hi> Yet, he tranſcends all thoſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct, ſucceſſive apprehenſions which are form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by them in a Glorious <hi>Variety. This</hi> is both Beautiful and Satisfying: It <hi>wins</hi> and holds Created Spirits <hi>Cloſe</hi> to it, with Admiration, and a boundleſs Complacency. It preſents and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold; the Divine Eſſence in a freſh degree of <hi>ſweetneſs,</hi> and it ſets an Edg on the Souls
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:48772:72"/>delight with an eager kind of <hi>fixedneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Conſider, that the Lord delights in himſelf, becauſe he is <hi>Optimus Maximus,</hi> the chiefeſt Goodneſs, and his own Ultimate End, into whom, all his Love and Delight expreſt upon the Creature, is <hi>Reſolved.</hi> Therefore, his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Beaming forth in the Creation, muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected upon <hi>himſelf</hi> who only <hi>ſees</hi> himſelf in his own Light of <hi>Purity,</hi> and enjoys himſelf in his own unparallel'd <hi>Beauty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In a ſtrict ſence, the Lord cannot look off from himſelf, nor rejoyce, nor take complacen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in any <hi>Created</hi> Excellency; becauſe himſelf ſhed it in <hi>meaſure</hi> on the higheſt Order of Angels that he might be more acknowledged and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired.</p>
               <p>Now, if there be a <hi>ſuitable</hi> Alſufficiency in God to ſatisfie and delight himſelf <hi>in himſelf</hi> to all Eternity, then 'tis but equitable, that Saints ſhould conform to this Duty, <hi>purely</hi> to delight in the Almighty for himſelf.</p>
               <p>It is the Lord's peculiar and ſole Prerogative, to <hi>challenge</hi> the delight of Saints and Angels. This is our <hi>ſafety</hi> rather, than <hi>ſervitude,</hi> or the <hi>Conſinement</hi> of our Affections, to refer all our deſires to <hi>his</hi> Wiſdom, that he ſhould Judg of them by approbation or diſlike: This is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve our very <hi>Being</hi> and <hi>Acting</hi> in the World, into the Sovereignty of his <hi>Will,</hi> which is our <hi>Priviledg,</hi> and the <hi>Reſtauration</hi> of our degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:48772:73"/>Nature to its Divine and Primitive Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity.</p>
               <p>The Soul is in a manner deprived of it <hi>ſelf,</hi> of its true Reſt, Contentment, Liberty, and Dominion over all paſſionate ſenſitive Deſires, while it <hi>Centers not</hi> in the Chiefeſt Good which is more amiable than the <hi>Soul</hi> it ſelf.</p>
               <p>It's thirſty propenſion will never ſuffer it ſelf to be <hi>controuled</hi> nor ſatisfyed by any of thoſe ſenſual Delights, which our <hi>Fancies</hi> offer to it.</p>
               <p>Thus the rareſt <hi>Muſick</hi> will not quiet the hungry Child, without the <hi>Mothers</hi> Breaſt.</p>
               <p>It is only <hi>That</hi> Self-ſufficient Goodneſs and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained</hi> Archetype of Beauty and Bleſſedneſs, which our delight ſhould be conſtantly catching <hi>after,</hi> and converſing <hi>with.</hi> This only can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get true <hi>ſerenity</hi> of mind, becauſe it is <hi>Adequate to,</hi> yea, infinitely excels and exceeds the vaſt unbounded deſires of our Souls.</p>
               <p>O the Happineſs of <hi>That</hi> Chriſtian, who by Mortification of Self-Love, ſtretches out the affections of his Soul upon the <hi>Immenſity</hi> of perfection with the greateſt Freedome and Delight.</p>
               <p>Weaned Saints, know how to live <hi>out</hi> of themſelves, <hi>in</hi> and <hi>upon</hi> God in Chriſt. In <hi>Their</hi> Divine imbraces, is only ſafety and ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to be expected, and not in thoſe <hi>tender</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearments, and <hi>ſenſitive</hi> Gratifications, which
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:48772:73"/>we contrive or compaſs for our ſelves.</p>
               <p>Indeed, the Soul is <hi>too bigg</hi> for Earthly De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns and Intereſts. <hi>This</hi> is the moſt Divine Life, when a Man Acts in the World upon <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal</hi> Deſignes; and is ſo wholly devoted to the Lord, <hi>as not</hi> to caſt the leaſt glance of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous Admiration toward any ſordid ſecular advantage, whereby the Heaven-born Soul is inthralled, even while ſenſual Luſts are grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</p>
               <p>Theſe cauſe Man to degenerate from himſelf, to Pinion and Debaſe himſelf, in extending his Affections upon Earthly Vanities.</p>
               <p>Would Chriſtians be more weaned from the purſuit of Luſts, and Worldly projects? Let them aſpire to be more ſuitable in their Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition and Converſation to the Father of their Spirits.</p>
               <p>It is only the <hi>Reſtauration</hi> of the Divine I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage (which produces an <hi>Harmony</hi> betwixt the Lords Will and ours) which can elevate our hearts, and refine or ſpiritualize our Affections to delight in God abſtractedly for himſelf, though he <hi>allure</hi> us not thereunto, by pouring in upon us the Confluence of Creature-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts.</p>
               <p>It is <hi>no leſs</hi> than an Almighty Power, which can <hi>thus</hi> overſway the Natural inclination of the Soul, that it ſhall deſiſt from living on the Creature <hi>without God,</hi> (which is Rapine and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledg)
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:48772:74"/>and ſhall ſettle its Choice on the moſt Abſolute, Intire, Univerſal Archetype of <hi>Beauty</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let this therefore, be a Demonſtration of our Holineſs, and the <hi>ſtrength</hi> of Renewing Grace, that we can cheerfully <hi>ſink</hi> and reject our own Intereſt, that the Lord may not be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed of the <hi>End</hi> of our Being and Acting in the World.</p>
               <p>Do not adopt his Intereſt unto <hi>yours</hi> only to <hi>ſerve</hi> your ſelves upon <hi>Him,</hi> and I dare ſay, the whole Creation ſhall ſerve you, to Facilitate your Obedience.</p>
               <p>This ſhall be the Happineſs of every weaned Self-denying Saint, whom the Lord delights to honour.</p>
               <p>If we prefer him to our Delight, before all the compounded, ſhallow, fading Excellencies of the Creature, He can give us our hearts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to the full, and will add no <hi>Sorrow</hi> with it.</p>
               <p>Together with the Confluence of Creature-Comforts, grow up greater <hi>Cares;</hi> our Table many times proves a <hi>Snare,</hi> and our Supplies our <hi>Surfeits.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But in the Complacential Love of God, is no danger, no fear of <hi>Exceſs,</hi> or of making any forfeiture. Here is no occaſion of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, for <hi>miſplacing</hi> of our hearts.</p>
               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:48772:74"/>
               <p>Other Delights cloy and ſatiate, but do not ſatisfy. But <hi>Spiritual</hi> Joys yield freſh ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs without Satiety.</p>
               <p>When we <hi>ſettle</hi> our Affections upon the Lord and his Excellencies, we tranſplant them from Earth to Heaven, to ripen in a <hi>better</hi> Climate.</p>
               <p>We <hi>loſe</hi> not, but only <hi>exchange</hi> our Joys for more ſolid durable refined Comforts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Regeneration, Adoption</hi> to an Heavenly Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, and the <hi>Kiſſes</hi> of Chriſt's Spirit, Sealing Communion with God through Chriſt, is a greater Cauſe of Glorying, than the higheſt Preferments in the World. Therefore let <hi>poor</hi> Saints rejoyce, that they are exalted in being weaned even to a <hi>Contempt</hi> of gilded Vanities; and let <hi>Rich</hi> Saints Glory in <hi>this,</hi> that they are <hi>Spiritually</hi> abaſed, and made vile in their own Eyes, as conſidering that Man is altogether Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in his <hi>beſt</hi> Eſtate: For when his Gracious endowments are improved to the higheſt pitch of excellency, they would <hi>yet</hi> fade away as the Beauty of a Flower, were they not rooted and preſerved in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>

                  <hi>What</hi> Hypocrites become by the Art of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimulation, appearing to <hi>Be</hi> that, and <hi>Do</hi> that, which they neither <hi>Are,</hi> nor <hi>Act</hi> in Truth.</p>
               <p>Such ſhould Saints become, by the <hi>right</hi> Art of Spiritual weaning;</p>
               <p>In the prudent regulation and compoſure of their Natural paſſions, they ſhould carry it ſo

He trades with Chriſt in Holy Duties, as if he traded not, becauſe he attributes no ſucceſs to his own skill and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, yea, his Spiritual gains or advantages are reaped and poſſeſt without obſervation by Carnal Perſons; towards whom his Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Heaven, (while himſelf remains a Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grim on Earth) is altogether a Myſtery and a Riddle.</p>
               <p>A weaned Self-denying Saint is ſilent and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in driving on ſecret Communion with the Lord, yet is he not ſlight and remiſs, but ſincerely fervent and fruitful in all the ways of Righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p>Thus Saints being weaned from their own Credit and Applauſe, make the fitteſt and moſt active Projectors for Chriſt's Honour and the Propagation of his Kingdom.</p>
               <p>But here it may be Objected by Chriſt's weak Babes, I fear I am not Spiritually weaned, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I cannot affirm that my Delight is fixed in the Lord.</p>
               <p>How little is my Mind Abſtracted from Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing with empty ſhadows, and how deeply Immerſed in ſenſitive feculent Delights! How ſeldom do the diſcoveries of the Lords infinite Excellencies transform me into a God-like Life.</p>
               <p>To this I Anſwer, thus in the General.</p>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:48772:76"/>
               <p>I intended <hi>That</hi> foregoing Character of wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Saints, rather for the Imitation of Babes in Chriſt, than to aſſert it to be the <hi>minimum quod ſic,</hi> the <hi>leaſt Eſſential</hi> qualifications, or Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Properties of ſincerity in Evangelical Wean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings.</p>
               <p>Chriſtians who falſly argue for a Nullity of Grace in themſelves from its Impotency, muſt conſider, that the right Art of Spiritual wean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is not eaſily learnt and practiſ'd, becauſe it is a Sacred Myſtery.</p>
               <p>Yet, New-born Saints are under the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of Chriſt's Spirit, who ſafely and tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly leads them through the Labyrinth of the Worlds Perplexing Cares and Temptations, that they may not be devoured by the <hi>Minotaur</hi> of a Fleſh-pleaſing Senſuality. Chriſt's very Babes have a ſupernatural Sagacity and Inſtinct to foreſee their Dangers; and being conſcious of their own Infirmity to reſiſt Temptations, they have ſo much ſtrength as to cry out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſantly, <hi>Abba, Father,</hi> ſuccour me with thy preventing aſſiſting Grace, that I may carry on that Weaning-Deſign, to which by Baptiſm I ſtand obliged.</p>
               <p>They <hi>can</hi> and <hi>do</hi> claim ſpiritual Kindred with God himſelf, nor will they deſiſt from pleading their ſpiritual Intereſt in his Wiſdom, Power, Love, Goodneſs and Faithfulneſs, to ſhield them from Temptations, and to promote their
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:48772:76"/>Self-denial to the Pitch of Heavenly-minded<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>They will creep as well as they can, into the Preſence of their Father; when they cannot run the way of his Commandments with inlarg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Affection anſwerable to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire.</p>
               <p>They teſtifie their Love and Gratitude, their Proweſs and Reſolution againſt ſin, Satan and the World, as they are Able; therefore, they ſhall (though <hi>weakly</hi> weaned) divide the Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtial Inheritance <hi>equally</hi> with the Angels who Excel in ſtrength.</p>
               <p>Take a really weaned Saint at the <hi>loweſt</hi> Ebb of his Affections Godward, yet, he is to be preferred before the moſt Zealous Hypocrite; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe as the World and his Luſts are the <hi>Joy</hi> of his Soul; ſo the Creature is the <hi>Soul</hi> of his Joy, and his Joy only the <hi>Blaze</hi> of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>But the Newly weaned Chriſtian doth not <hi>ſo</hi> eagerly intermeddle with worldly concernments, as quite to Degenerate and Degrade himſelf from his Spiritual Conſtitution, by becoming <hi>One Spirit</hi> with Senſitive Objects of a Baſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loy.</p>
               <p>He never <hi>ſo</hi> mixes his Heart with, nor lifts it up to Creature-Vanities as quite to loſe the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacity of his Soul, in not apprehending any quick touch of the Divine Greatneſs, or not
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:48772:77"/>reliſhing the ſweetneſs of the Infinite Goodneſs of the Lord.</p>
               <p>Still there is a more potent ſupernatural Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple within him drawing off his heart from a Purſuit of the <hi>Dunghil</hi>-Profits and <hi>beſotting</hi>-Pleaſures of the World. So that, as the Needle in the Mariners Compaſs, he is ſtill reſtleſs till he Center in the Increated Perfections of the Supream Being, and Original Source of All things.</p>
               <p>Still he prays wean me and I ſhall be weaned, for thou art my <hi>Praiſe,</hi> that is, the ſuperexcel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Object of my Love and Delight. If at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny time Chriſt's weaned Babes <hi>wonder</hi> at the Grandure, and <hi>wander</hi> after the Allurements of the World, by a ſhort Gratification of their Senſes; yet they ſoon check their folly, repent of it, lay a ſolemn Charge on their deluded Souls that they ſhould return to the Lord, as their Genuine Reſt, by compleat Satisfaction in Him alone. They beg to be eſtabliſht by the Magnetick Power and the moſt endearing Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations of Divine Love.</p>
               <p>They exerciſe on themſelves all the Rules of Spiritual weaning, with the greateſt ſtrictneſs and ſeverity.</p>
               <p>Their Self-denial holds <hi>Pace</hi> with their gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual diſcoveries of the Lord's Excellencies. The motion of their Souls Heavenward, mounts up ſutably to their <hi>Acquaintance</hi> with their Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:48772:77"/>Father. Their Spiritual <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Life,</hi> are commenſurate.</p>
               <p>The weakeſt Babe in Chriſt <hi>digeſts</hi> his Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg into ſtudious &amp; ſincere Obedience, although <hi>he</hi> be not <hi>ſwift</hi> upon the Wing, becauſe a dull Earthly Body clogs his Generous Soul. Yet, <hi>That</hi> Divine Nature, which he hath received, will grow up to a ſtronger Conſtitution, till it <hi>caſt</hi> and <hi>work</hi> out all thoſe Obſtructions of ſenſual Paſſions, which at preſent damp his Spiritual Zeal and Comfort.</p>
               <p>There is ſuch an implanted principle of a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Life, <hi>diſplaying</hi> it ſelf in every New-born Chriſtian; that the eſtimation of the Lord's lovely Beauty and infinite Worth <hi>Preponderates</hi> the excellencies of the whole Creation.</p>
               <p>If the Weakeſt of Chriſt's Weanlings were put to his Choice, whether he would loſe an Intereſt in God or the Creature; he would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reject with the greateſt abhorrency the the Worlds ſofteſt and tendereſt Imbraces, than thoſe pureſt Delights, which endear his heart to the Lord, in the midſt of all Temporal wants and loſſes.</p>
               <p>If the Lord ſhould ſay to a truly weaned Saint thou ſhalt be freed from Hell, twelve Princes ſhall proceed from thee, but I will not by Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant beſtow my ſelf upon thee, this very Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriction would be an Hell. For it is only Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety in God himſelf, which can ſatisfy a Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:48772:78"/>heart. It will deny it ſelf to enjoy an Intereſt in God, but if the Lord deny his Loving-kindneſs which is better than Life; all other Enjoyments will be Joyleſs; a weaned Saint will write upon them all, <hi>The Glory is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then</hi> will Worldly Men believe, that you are in good earneſt in Profeſſing your ſelves to be Pilgrims on Earth; that there is a Kingdom which cannot be ſhaken, which you are Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctants of, and Candidates for, when you moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and debaſe your ſelves, that God may be <hi>All</hi> in <hi>All.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Weaned Saints will deſcend by Humility, when they are advanced to the pitch of Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-mindedneſs, or the greateſt Communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Lords Grace and Favour.</p>
               <p>Then they ſee moſt cauſe of abaſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by conſtant Dependency on the Lord.</p>
               <p>Creatures the more excellent they are in their Being and Operation, the more frail and brittle they would become, if left to a Self-ſubſiſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</p>
               <p>Even the Spirits of Juſt Men made perfect modeſtly, and chearfully acknowledg that they ſhine with a <hi>Precarious</hi> Excellency borrowed from that <hi>Fountain of Light,</hi> who Enamels their Crowns with Stars of Glory; therefore they caſt them down at the Foot of the Lamb. Theſe Celeſtial Favourites applaud not their
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:48772:78"/>own perfections; but while they ſun themſelves in the Rays of Chriſt's Divinity, they pay a grateful Homage of Adoration to the Archetype of their Bleſſedneſs.</p>
               <p>The perfect <hi>Viſion</hi> of the God of Glory be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets perfect Transformation in a Glorions State. Yet, the Saints Satisfaction is only in his U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with, and Enjoyment of the Lord <hi>Himſelf,</hi> as the Eſſential and Infinite Object of Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, as Sojourners upon Earth, they tread all ſublunary Vanities under their Feet.</p>
               <p>Weaned Chriſtians who wait upon the Lord, are compared to Eagles, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.31.</p>
               <p>This King of Birds hath a ſtrong Wing, a ſwift Flight, a quick piercing Eye, and is uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſecure from the ſtroke of Thunder. Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly contemplative Souls (while ſuch) are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the reach of Satan's Temptations. It is for Batts and Owls to flie near the foggy dull Earth. But the Soul of a weaned Chriſtian is of too Noble an Original to ſtoop ſo low, as to think it can be beautified by the acceſſion of any worldly accommodation.</p>
               <p>They affect Earthly Conveniencies no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than they may be Advantages in ſeeking Heavenly Graces. By an Art of Spiritual Chymiſtry they can ſublimate the unrighteous Mammon into true Charity, Honour into Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:48772:79"/>and Worldly Pleaſure into a Recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Divine Joy, becoming the New-Man.</p>
               <p>They Spiritualize all the droſs of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, they make a Divine improvement on that very indifferent Comfort, which Satan would Convert into a Snare.</p>
               <p>They account a weaned State to be the Life of Heaven upon Earth. Thus they take a Survey of the Holy-Land, and enter Paradiſe in their thoughts before they take poſſeſſion in their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. Little do Worldlings know what tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting Delights weaned Saints enjoy in their ſecret Retirements from the World.</p>
               <p>Theſe Doves which ſeek Solitude for Holy Meditation, have the fulleſt diſcoveries of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Glory. How are their Wings covered o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver with Golden Apparitions, in clear Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from the Spirit of Truth, when their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are not clouded with the groſs Fumes and Vapors of Terreſtrial Delights; nor their Affections clog'd by ſinking in the Bogs of Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuality!</p>
               <p>The very <hi>Vices</hi> of Worldlings are improved by Chriſt's Weanlings, unto a Religious Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. Covetous Men (like <hi>Nero</hi>) cruelly dig into the Bowels of their <hi>Mother-Earth,</hi> to ſearch for Veins of Gold and Silver, which the God of Nature hath on purpoſe hid, leſt they ſhould prove Traitors to his Majeſty, by winning o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:48772:79"/>our Affections unto Vanity. Yet, ſuch is their folly, that like <hi>Antaeus</hi> or Conſumptive Perſons, they think to recover the ſtrength of Contentment by ſmelling to, and embracing of the Earth.</p>
               <p>But weaned Saints dig into the Rich Mines of the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> thereby to diſcover and poſſeſs themſelves of Chriſt, in whom are hid all the Treaſures of Divine Wiſdom, and the unſeen Joys of Celeſtial Contemplation. Yet, are they not inquiſitive by a bold Curioſity, where God would have them Ignorant.</p>
               <p>Weaned Saints being mindful of their Divine Original, make every Creature-Comfort a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct round in <hi>Jacob's</hi> Ladder, whereon they climb to Heaven; that they may obtain fuller Communion with the Father of their Spirits, to beget ſweeter and more ſatisfying Taſtcs of Divine Love and Bounty.</p>
               <p>They count it Honor enough to be New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born from Above; and eſteem it a Chiefer part of their Felicity, that they are made <hi>meet and fit</hi> for Heaven, than that their Names are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven on their Celeſtial Manſions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they take the Triumphant Poſſeſſion of them.</p>
               <p>They are highly Ambitious even in their Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage; yet 'tis only to pleaſe the Lord in their Converſation, which is carried on in a Myſtery toward the World.</p>
               <pb n="142" facs="tcp:48772:80"/>
               <p>They conſtantly Lye ſucking <hi>In</hi> pure Delights from the Ocean of Immenſe Felicity, with more than <hi>Epicurean</hi> gredineſs. When they obtain the Choiceſt and Richeſt Effuſions of Divine Love, they are <hi>Covetouſly</hi> reſtleſs; and <hi>Impatiently</hi> thirſty after more of the Invigorating Influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Holy Spirit.</p>
               <p>They Bathe their <hi>Dove-like</hi> Minds not in the <hi>Lethean</hi> Lake of Senſual Pleaſures, but in the Chryſtal Streams of Truth and Righteouſneſs. They Prune their Wings <hi>(viz.)</hi> the diſcompo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Affections of their Souls by Heavenly Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpection and Curioſity. Their hearts are <hi>impregnated</hi> with Zeal by the Spirit of Life and Righteouſneſs, yet are they not <hi>puft up</hi> with Pride, nor a conceited Self-Sufficiency, under their higheſt attainments in Holineſs, or in Comfort.</p>
               <p>Other Creatures may forget and forſake the Damme when weaned; but every Self-denying Chriſtian, more cleaves to, and waits upon the Lord, as not able to ſubſiſt <hi>Alone,</hi> nor lead a Separate Life from the Fountain of pure Joy, when moſt incompaſt with the Enjoyments of the World, or the Comfortable quickning influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of the Holy Spirit.</p>
               <p>Even in <hi>Heaven</hi> they ſhall <hi>Moſt</hi> and <hi>Beſt</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire, yea Adore the Infinite Perfections of God in Chriſt. They ſhall Eternally Acknowledg and Complacentially Deſcant on <hi>that Divine
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:48772:80"/>Power</hi> which ſubjected them to a weaned E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrangement from the World, or any Confidence in a Self-Righteouſneſs, according to that Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion of the Prophet <hi>Iſa. ch.</hi> 45, <hi>v.</hi> 25. <hi>In the Lord ſhall all the Spiritual Seed of</hi> Iſrael <hi>be Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and ſhall Glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus they ſhall rejoycingly Acquicſce, not ſo in the State of their Perſonal Salvation, as Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph in the Lamb of God, who Redeemed them by his Blood, from Worldly Allurements, and all pollutions of Fleſh and Spirit.</p>
               <p>To this Author and Finiſher of our Faith, to this <hi>Pattern</hi> of Self-Abaſement, who humbled Himſelf to the Death of the Croſs, that he might wean us from doting on Earthly Vanities, and raiſe our hearts to admire and chuſe the <hi>ever-Bleſſed Deity,</hi> for our Al-ſatisfying <hi>Portion;</hi> be aſcribed, as is moſt due, All Honour, Adoration, and Glory, both Now, and to all Eternity, <hi>Amen, Amen.</hi>
